abstract = {This study explores the relationship between historical exposure to the built environment and current vehicle ownership patterns. The influence of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations. Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative explanations by including the built environment attributes of households' past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that models that include current but not past neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well. However, models that include both current and past neighborhood attributes can provide a more nuanced understanding of the built environment's potentially causal influences on vehicle ownership decisions. This better understanding may provide more realistic forecasts of responses to densification or other travel demand management strategies.},

abstract = {Auto ownership is a critical mediating link in the connection between the built environment and travel behavior: the built environment presumably influences auto ownership, which in turn impacts travel behavior. However, the way in which individual elements of the built environment affect auto-ownership choices is far from understood. Further, residential self-selection may confound the interaction between the built environment and auto ownership. And the absence of panel data impedes our understanding of the causal relationships. Using a survey of 1682 respondents in Northern California, we applied ordered probit and static-score modeling techniques to investigate the causal link from the built environment to auto ownership in both cross-sectional and quasi-panel contexts. Through variable selection in cross-sectional analysis, we found that individuals' attitudes regarding residential neighborhood and travel are more strongly associated with their auto-ownership decision than is the built environment per se. Specifically, when general preferences for various neighborhood traits were allowed to enter the model, they drove out from the model the (perceived) measure of the same trait for the neighborhood of current residence, a pattern suggesting that the observed correla- tion between neighborhood characteristics and auto ownership is primarily a result of self-selection. On the other hand, the quasi-panel results indicate that some built-environment elements such as outdoor spaciousness and mixed land use are causes of auto ownership (remaining even after attitudes were allowed to enter the model), but their effects are marginal. In contrast, the strong influence of sociodemographics suggests that households' auto-ownership decisions are fundamentally based on their mobility needs and purchasing power. Given the mixed findings, we do not definitively confirm a causal relationship between the built environment and auto ownership. However, we provide encour- aging evidence that land-use policies designed to reduce auto ownership and use will lead to a marginal reduction in auto ownership.},

Cao et al. used quasi-panel data collected from a survey to evaluate the effects of attitudinal and built-environment characteristics on automobile ownership. The data are collected by mail-back surveys, using a residential advertising list as the sampling frame. The sampling strategy explicity separated traditional neighborhoods from suburban developments, and movers from non-movers. Respondents were asked questions regarding neighborhood characteristics, neighborhood preference, travel attitude, and sociodemographics. Scores are created for characteristics, preferences, and attitudes. The auto ownership of movers is also modeled with a static score model.




The authors report two ordered probit models on the cross-sectional data: one excluding travel attitudes and neighborhood preferences, and the other including them. Including attitudes and preferences significantly improves the model prediction, and also renders stated neighborhood characteristics immaterial. 




The simplifying reasons for reducing the survey responses to attribute scores are obvious, but I worry that information may be lost in the conversion. I am not familiar with the pattern matrix used to normalize these things (if that is in fact what it does), it nevertheless seems that the questions should have been incorporated into some model directly. The fact that stated preference variables supersede revealed preference variables in the model is similarly puzzling, but this could be simply a fact of individuals remaining unsatisfied with their current environments. 




The main contribution of this paper is that it quantifies the effect of residential self-selection bias, and yet leaves open the possibility for causal relationships between the built environment of a residential location and auto ownership.},

abstract = {We provide new results regarding the identification of peer effects. We consider an extended version of the linear-in-means model where interactions are structured through a social network. We assume that correlated unobservables are either absent, or treated as network fixed effects. We provide easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions for identification. We show that endogenous and exogenous effects are generally identified under network interaction, although identification may fail for some particular structures. We use data from the Add Health survey to provide an empirical application of our results on the consumption of recreational services (e.g., participation in artistic, sports and social activities) by secondary school students. Monte Carlo simulations calibrated on this application provide an analysis of the effects of some crucial characteristics of a network (i.e., density, intransitivity) on the estimates of peer effects. Our approach generalizes a number of previous results due to Manski [Manski, C., 1993. Identification of endogenous social effects: The reflection problem.

abstract = {Household vehicle ownership and fleet composition are choice dimensions that have important implications for policy making, particularly in the energy and environmental sustainability arena. In the context of household vehicle ownership and type choice, it is conceivable that there are substantial spatial interaction effects due to both observed and unobserved factors. This paper presents a multinomial probit model formulation that incorporates spatial spillover effects arising from both observed and unobserved factors. The model is capable of endogenously estimating the number of vehicles of each type that a household acquires by using a synthetic choice occasion approach where households are assumed to purchase vehicles over a series of choice occasions. The model is estimated on the California add-on data set of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. Model estimation results show that spatial dependency effects are statistically significant. The findings have important implications for model development and application in the policy forecasting arena.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of online social networking over the past decade has generated substantial amounts of data about individuals and their social relationships. Recent research studies investigating social relationships and travel behavior have sought connections between individuals' social networks and socially related travel; however, to the authors' knowledge, no study has pursued the use of online social networking data to do so. This study explores the use of online social network data in characterizing individuals' air travel behavior. Data were collected through a web-based survey including information about individuals' air travel history and online social network information, specifically participants' Facebook networks. The data were then analyzed to address a series of hypotheses about the association between online social network characteristics (specifically Facebook) and air travel behavior, in particular, travel distance, leisure-related travel, and trip generation. This study found a positive relationship between the size and distribution of individuals' Facebook social networks and both their engagement in air travel and the odds that their air travel will be leisure related or will include a leisure component.},

@article{Pinjari2011,
abstract = {The integrated modeling of land use and transportation choices involves analyzing a continuum of choices that characterize people's lifestyles across temporal scales. This includes long-term choices such as residential and work location choices that affect land-use, medium-term choices such as vehicle ownership, and short-term choices such as travel mode choice that affect travel demand. Prior research in this area has been limited by the complexities associated with the development of integrated model systems that combine the long-, medium- and short-term choices into a unified analytical framework. This paper presents an integrated simultaneous multi-dimensional choice model of residential location, auto ownership, bicycle ownership, and commute tour mode choices using a mixed multidimensional choice modeling methodology. Model estimation results using the San Francisco Bay Area highlight a series of interdependencies among the multi-dimensional choice processes. The interdependencies include: (1) self-selection effects due to observed and unobserved factors, where households locate based on lifestyle and mobility preferences, (2) endogeneity effects, where any one choice dimension is not exogenous to another, but is endogenous to the system as a whole, (3) correlated error structures, where common unobserved factors significantly and simultaneously impact multiple choice dimensions, and (4) unobserved heterogeneity, where decision-makers show significant variation in sensitivity to explanatory variables due to unobserved factors. From a policy standpoint, to be able to forecast the 'true' causal influence of activity-travel environment changes on residential location, auto/bicycle ownership, and commute mode choices, it is necessary to capture the above-identified interdependencies by jointly modeling the multiple choice dimensions in an integrated framework.

Na ̈ıve estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and spatially endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market. We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression. This finding has unpredictable consequences for land value capture forecasts and transportation policy decisions.},

abstract = {In the past few years, numerous mobile applications have made it possible for public tran- sit passengers to find routes and/or learn about the expected arrival time of their transit vehicles. Though these services are widely used, their impact on overall transit ridership remains unclear. The objective of this research is to assess the effect of real-time informa- tion provided via web-enabled and mobile devices on public transit ridership. An empirical evaluation is conducted for New York City, which is the setting of a natural experiment in which a real-time bus tracking system was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis beginning in 2011. Panel regression techniques are used to evaluate bus ridership over a three year period, while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socio- economic conditions, weather, and other factors. A fixed effects model of average weekday unlinked bus trips per month reveals an increase of approximately 118 trips per route per weekday (median increase of 1.7{\%} of weekday route-level ridership) attributable to provid- ing real-time information. Further refinement of the fixed effects model suggests that this ridership increase may only be occurring on larger routes; specifically, the largest quartile of routes defined by revenue miles of service realized approximately 340 additional trips per route per weekday (median increase of 2.3{\%} per route). Although the increase in week- day route-level ridership may appear modest, on aggregate these increases exert a substan- tial positive effect on farebox revenue. The implications of this research are critical to decision-makers at the country's transit operators who face pressure to increase ridership under limited budgets, particularly as they seek to prioritize investments in infrastructure, service offerings, and new technologies.

abstract = {Travel demand models and network simulation models are distinct sets of procedures that are combined and interact within the framework of regional transportation modeling systems. Conventional four-step models have numerous limitations compared with more advanced activity-based microsimulation models, primarily with respect to internal consistency and detailed behavioral realism. However, two of the remaining advantages of four-step models are an established theory and an effective set of practical rules for achieving global network equilibrium so that travel time and cost simulated in the networks exactly correspond to the demand (trip tables) generated by the model. Nonetheless, this issue remains less explored and somewhat obscure for activity-based models. These models have a more complicated analytical structure compared with four-step models, which makes it difficult to derive equilibrium conditions in a rigorous theoretical manner. In addition, implementation of an activity-based model requires microsimulation of individual outcomes in the form of "crisp" discrete choices that is very different from the summation of fractional probabilities implemented in conventional models. This paper documents the results of testing various equilibrium strategies implemented with the New York City activity-based microsimulation regional travel demand model used by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. The purpose of the paper is twofold. First, it is intended to outline some fundamental research directions and extensions of the network equilibrium theory to cover activity-based microsimulation models in a more rigorous way. Second, it describes realistic levels of convergence that can be achieved with activity-based microsimulation models in practice and establishes practical rules and protocols for using these types of models for different projects and policies.},

abstract = {Microsimulation is increasingly assuming a major role in the advancement of demand-modeling practice. At the same time, it is attracting growing attention from the larger transportation-planning community. Four basic advantages of microsimulation versus conventional fractional-probability models are examined. The first is the technical advantage related to computational savings in the calculation and storage of large multidimensional probability arrays. The second is the meaningful advantage gained in the explicit modeling of various decision-making chains and time-space constraints on individual travel that allows for behavioral realism in the demand-modeling procedure. The third relates to the variability of microsimulation outcomes, which can yield full information about the distributions of the travel demand statistics of interest rather than single deterministic estimates or average values. As soon as constraints are introduced into the modeling framework (which often is done at the destination choice stage), competition arises, although generally it has been ignored in standard models. Microsimulation has the potential to handle this competition over work attractions and other travel activities in a meaningful fashion, which is the fourth advantage. These four advantages of microsimulation are discussed in light of the recent development and application of the New York best practice model, a microsimulation demand-modeling system for the New {\{}York,New{\}} {\{}Jersey,Connecticut{\}} metropolitan area.},

abstract = {Data needs for developing travel demand models have increased at the same time that household travel survey (HTS) participation rates have generally fallen over recent decades. GPS-assisted HTS methods are rec- ognized today as the most promising direction in further enhancement of individual travel data collection. The principal advantage of the GPS- assisted survey technology is that a full stream of locations visited by the person is identified with a high level of spatial and temporal resolution, but automatic identification of trip purpose remains an issue that is diffi- cult to solve. This paper evaluates the performance of two methods, choice modeling and decision tree analysis, that can be used to build models capable of identifying trip purpose. The developed methods assume that basic household- and person-level data, typically collected in an HTS, are available, as are supporting spatial data sets. The methods presented are then evaluated for a case study that employed data from the 2011 Atlanta Regional Commission HTS. The developed models produced encourag- ing results with overall accuracy greater than 70{\%} across all purposes and around 90{\%} for mandatory activities (i.e., work and school). The performance of the developed models was evaluated in terms of error rates by purpose category and the impact of ancillary spatial data. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings and recommendations for practitioners.},

abstract = {Over the past few years many travel demand modelers have come to the realization that their static traffic assignment algorithm is inadequate. As the demand portion of our models become more sophisticated, we are able to confidently model and compare many policy scenarios. Embarrassingly, within the limits of static traffic assignment we cannot calculate such simple measures as travel time between an origin and destination without a string of caveats attached. Nor can we provide volume-to- capacity ratios that traffic engineers won't laugh at. Unfortunately, many of these simple “skims” that we are so unsure about in static assignment are fed back in to our demand models. How well can our sophisticated demand models do when they are being fed wrong inputs from the start? All signs seem to be pointing to simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) as the solution to our static assignment ailments, but no regional modeling agency has (to our knowledge) taken the plunge to actively explore DTA as a possible replacement for static assignment. To date, several examples of simulation-based equilibrium DTA models coupled with regional travel demand models exist. However, extraordinary run times and complexity have diminished their usefulness outside of research or for some very specific projects. This paper shares our experience to date: strategies, approach, and discoveries in applying DTA in San Francisco to evaluate its feasibility to be a part of our regional demand model as we explored various DTA packages. 19},

abstract = {Oregon has a long history of developing and using integrated economic,land use-transport models. Development of the Oregon Statewide Integrated Model (SWIM) was commissioned by the Oregon Department of Transportation as part of its Transportation and Land Use Model Improvement Program within the larger Oregon Modeling Improvement Program. The first version model, now named SWIM1, has been used in numerous applications since the late 1990s. A more extensive second version, SWIM2, is now available. It uses the PECAS economic input-output activity allocation framework, an aggregate model of spatial development and microsimulation models of freight and person transport. This paper describes the work considered in the later stages of development of the SWIM2 model, including results of sensitivity testing and reports on concurrent actions to transfer the model to agency operation. The sensitivity tests considered three alternative scenarios covering the evolution of the statewide spatial economic and transport systems over a 19-year period. Each scenario was compared to a reference case. In one scenario, highway capacity was increased substantially along an Interstate corridor radiating out from the Portland metropolitan area for more than 100 mi. In the other two scenarios, the costs for vehicle travel were increased four- and 10-fold over 1998 costs. The model system was found to respond consistent with a priori expectations. Population and employment shift to areas of comparatively better accessibilities, urban densities change, trip lengths and modes change, and floor space development and prices respond to these changes in patterns that evolve across the state over time.},

abstract = {This study explores the relationship between historical exposure to the built environment and current vehicle ownership patterns. The influence of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations. Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative explanations by including the built environment attributes of households' past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that models that include current but not past neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well. However, models that include both current and past neighborhood attributes can provide a more nuanced understanding of the built environment's potentially causal influences on vehicle ownership decisions. This better understanding may provide more realistic forecasts of responses to densification or other travel demand management strategies.},

abstract = {Many U.S. cities use vehicle emissions testing programs to improve air quality by identifying gross polluting vehicles and requiring their owners to make emissions-related repairs. All vehicles that meet certain criteria must pass an emissions test as part of the vehicle registration process. States use different criteria to determine which vehicles must be tested; however, the equity impacts associated with various screening criteria are unknown. This is due to difficulties researchers have faced in linking vehicle and household characteristics. We investigate the relative influence of vehicle and household characteristics on emissions failures in Atlanta, Georgia, by linking its emissions testing database to a targeted marketing database; the latter contains information about vehicle owners. We use count and hurdle models to predict vehicle emissions failures. Our model finds a relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failures after controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical vehicles, the one owned by a low-income or minority household is more likely to fail emissions. We use our model to investigate the impacts of different emissions testing policies by income and ethnic groups.},

abstract = {A key difference between stochastic microsimulation models and more traditional forms of travel demand forecasting models is that microsimulation-based forecasts change each time the sequence of random numbers used to simulate choices is varied. To address practitioners' concerns about this variation, a common approach is to run the microsimulation model several times and average the results. The question then becomes: What is the minimum number of runs required to reach a true average state for a given set of model results? This issue was investigated by means of a systematic experiment with the San Francisco model, a microsimulation model system used in actual planning applications since 2000. The system contains models of vehicle availability, day pattern choice, tour time-of-day choice, destination choice, and mode choice. To investigate the variability of the forecasts of this system due to random simulation error, the model system was run 100 times, each time changing only the sequence of random numbers used to simulate individual choices from the logit model probabilities. The extent of random variability in the model results is reported as a function of two factors: (a) the type of model (vehicle availability, tour generation, destination choice, or mode choice); and (b) the level of geographic detail—transit at the analysis zone level, neighborhood level, or countywide level. For each combination of these factors, it is shown graphically how quickly the mean values of key output variables converge toward a stable value as the number of simulation runs increases.},

abstract = {Regional travel models in the United States are clearly evolving from conventional models towards a new generation of more behaviorally realistic activity-based models. The new generation of regional travel demand models is characterized by three features: (1) an activity-based platform, that implies that modeled travel be derived within a general framework of the daily activities undertaken by households and persons, (2) a tour-based structure of travel where the tour is used as the basic unit of modeling travel instead of the elemental trip, and (3) micro-simulation modeling techniques that are applied at the fully-disaggregate level of persons and households, which convert activity and travel related choices from fractional-probability model outcomes into a series of discrete or “crisp” decisions. While the new generation of model has obvious conceptual advantages over the conventional four-step models, there are still numerous technical issues that have to be addressed as well as a better understanding of practical benefits should be achieved before the new generation of models can fully replace conventional models. The paper summarizes the recent successful experience in the development and application of activity-based demand models for Metropolitan Planning Organizations in the US. Moving activity-based approaches into practice is analyzed in a broad context of travel demand modeling market tendencies and policy implications.},

abstract = {Currently, modal split modeling is done mainly by means of disaggregated mode choice models. The almost absolute dominance of multinomial and nested logit models over other mode choice models among applied transportation modelers is attributable to their theoretical soundness, to their simple and understandable analytical structure, and to the calibration procedures that have been developed. Typical urban transport systems, however, are characterized by a variety of modes including private (automobile), public transit (bus, suburban rail, light rail, and subway), and various combinations of these. Analysis reveals that the nested logit model based on the assumption of groupwise similarities among modes is not a suitable modeling tool in such situations. A cross-nested model that is derived from the generalized extreme value class and that can be thought of as a generalization of the nested logit model is proposed. The model takes into account the cross similarities between different pure and combined modes. The cross-nested structure allows for the introduction of the differentiated measurement of pairwise similarities among modes as opposed to the inflexible groupwise similarities permitted by the nested logit model. The proposed model is described, and it is compared with alternative modeling constructs.},

abstract = {Activity-based models are increasingly attractive as alternatives to traditional trip-based travel demand forecasting models because of growing dissatisfaction with the internal consistency, aggregation bias, and lack of detail of trip-based approaches. New policy analysis requirements demand that forecasting models represent travel choices and the contexts in which these travel choices are made with ever-increasing geographic, temporal, and behavioral detail. Activity-based models can incorporate this detail and can provide decision makers with more precise insights into potential outcomes of transportation and land use investment and development strategies. The model of San Francisco, California, is a tour-based microsimulation model that forecasts daily activity patterns for individual San Francisco residents and has been used in transportation planning practice since 2000. The San Francisco model uses the daily activity pattern approach, first introduced by Bowman and Ben-Akiva, within a disaggregate microsimulation framework. This paper describes an application of the San Francisco model to the proposed new Central Subway project in downtown San Francisco. This is the first application of an activity-based travel demand model in the United States to a major infrastructure project in support of a submission to FTA for project funding through the New Starts program. To enable the submittal of a New Starts request, software was developed to collapse the micro- simulation output of the tour and trip mode choice models into a format compatible with the FTA SUMMIT program. SUMMIT was then successfully used to summarize and analyze user benefits accruing to the project and to prepare an acceptable New Starts submittal.},

abstract = {In current practice, regional models are limited in their capability to analyze policies involving changes and improvements to airports (and their services) and ground access transportation. Typically, airports are treated only as employment centers or as special generators. Important and distinct features of air passenger travel affecting trip distribution and mode choice are rarely modeled explicitly. This paper presents the development of a joint airport and ground access mode choice model for the New York City metropolitan region based on an extensive survey of airport users. Unlike travel to and from most U.S. cities, air passengers flying to and from the New York region face a nontriivial choice of airports and ground access modes (including premium transit options). A nested logit model was formulated with airport choice at the upper level and ground access mode choice at the second level; however, a multinomial logit model was found to be statistically preferable, Results indicate that air passenger travel behavior is significantly different for business and nonbusiness travelers. Overall, willingness to pay for trips to and from the airport is much higher than for regular intracity trips. Average yield, access time, and access cost are the most important determinants of air passenger's choice; demographics and trip characteristics are also significant. The developed tool was used for a comprehensive study of airport development alternatives in the New York region and is seen as the platform for additional data development and model extensions for future studies of air passenger service planning in the New York megaregion},

In addition, statistical evidence demonstrates that the vast majority of shared-ride travel consists of joint household travel. A modeling approach that distinguishes shared activity-based joint household travel from arranged interhousehold carpooling is clearly desirable to support accurate forecasts of shared-ride travel, critical in the evaluation of high-occupancy vehicle lanes or the adoption of toll strategies differentiated by occupancy levels.

These models were developed as part of an overall tour-based travel demand forecasting model (SF model) for the San Francisco County Transportation Authority to provide detailed forecasts of travel demand for various planning applications. The models described represent two of the nine primary components of the SF model. Both model components consist of multiple logit choice models and include both tour-level models (which refer to the primary activity of the tour) and trip-level models (other activities on the tour). A separate model was estimated for each tour purpose, including work, school, other, and work-based. The destination choice models combine the trip attraction and trip distribution components of the traditional four-step process and use a multinomial logit specification. The mode choice models utilize a nested logit formulation to capture the similarities among sets of similar modes. The two models are linked by incorporating the mode choice utility logsum in the destination choice models; the result is equivalent to a nested structure with a mode choice nest under destination choice. It is demonstrated that the microsimulation approach easily allows the inclusion of a number of key variables in destination and mode choice models that have a significant explanatory power compared with those in traditional models. It is also shown that this approach allows estimation of the effects of tour characteristics on the choice of destination and mode using widely available data and estimation procedures.},

abstract = {Household maintenance activities and associated tours, even if individually implemented, should be thought of as satisfying the needs of the entire household rather than simply the needs of the person who implements the activity. These activities are characterized by a high degree of substitution between household members who could implement them. This characteristic suggests a modeling structure in which maintenance activities are generated by the entire household and then allocated to the household members for implementation. In this approach, the modeling of allocated activities is executed by a sequence of two linked discrete choice models. The first model relates to the entire household and returns total daily frequency of individual maintenance tours by purpose. The second model relates to the tour level and returns the allocation of each generated tour to a particular household member. Within the general framework of a regional demand modeling system, these models are applied after, and are conditional on, the mandatory and joint tour generation stage. The statistical analysis and model estimation for this implementation of allocated household maintenance activities allow for important insights into the intrahousehold decision-making mechanism and improved travel demand forecasts. Models of this type have been implemented as components of the regional travel demand modeling system recently developed for the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission.},

abstract = {This paper describes design features of several different regional activity- based models (ABMs) that share the coordinated travel–regional activity modeling platform (CT-RAMP) design and software platform. The CT- RAMP models are characterized by features such as a full simulation of travel decisions for discrete households and persons, explicit tracking of time in half-hourly increments, the use of time constraints on the generation of travel, and explicitly modeled intrahousehold interactions across a range of activity and travel dimensions. These important features allow for greater behavioral realism in representing the response to numerous transportation policies. Each implementation of the CT-RAMP system, as for many ABM systems used in practice over the years, shares certain common features with others. However, each implementation is tailored to address specific regional conditions and includes additional advanced fea- tures to provide increased policy sensitivity and greater behavioral realism. These features are explained in the paper and analyzed in the context of model applications for different transportation projects and policies. Some of these features stem from ongoing intensive research and development in the field, including cross-pollination of ideas between the CT- RAMP family and other ABMs developed elsewhere, but many other features are unique and were driven by practical needs. The main conclusion of this paper is that it is too early to establish a completely generic and standard approach to an ABM design in practice. The evolution of features in ABMs still continues and is driven by theoretical achievements in behavior research and practical considerations.},

abstract = {The great housing convulsion that buffeted America between 2000 and 2010 has historical precedents, from the frontier land boom of the 1790s to the skyscraper craze of the 1920s. But this time was different. There was far less real uncertainty about fundamental economic and geographic trends, making the convulsion even more puzzling. During historic and recent booms, sensible models could justify high prices on the basis of seemingly reasonable projections about stable or growing prices. The recurring error appears to be a failure to anticipate the impact that elastic supply will eventually have on prices, whether for cotton in Alabama in 1820 or land in Las Vegas in 2006. Buyers don't appear to be irrational but rather cognitively limited investors who work with simple heuristic models, instead of a comprehensive general equilibrium framework. Low interest rates rarely seem to drive price growth; under-priced default options are a more common contributor to high prices. The primary cost of booms has not typically been overbuilding, but rather the financial chaos that accompanies housing downturns.},

abstract = {Given that recent literature reviews on physical activity in urban parks deliberately excluded qualitative findings, we reviewed qualitative research on this topic informed by a published classification scheme based on quantitative research. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies relied mainly on semi-structured interviews with individuals or in focus groups; only five studies involved in situ observation. Our synthesis aligns with previous quantitative research showing that attributes including safety, aesthetics, amenities, maintenance, and proximity are important for encouraging park use. Furthermore, our synthesis of qualitative research suggests that perceptions of the social environment entwine inextricably with perceptions of the physical environment. If so, physical attributes of parks as well as perceptions of these attributes (formed in relation to broader social contexts) may influence physical activity patterns. Both qualitative and quantitative methods provide useful information for interpreting such patterns, and in particular, when designing and assessing interventions intended to improve the amount and intensity of physical activity.},

This study first presents Taiwan's HSR system development and conducts an ex post cost–benefit analysis of this transportation system. Second, unsatisfied ridership is examined to look for possible solutions to increase it. Third, the paper examines the impact of HSR on the intercity transportation market. Finally, the integration between HSR and various existing transportation modes is discussed. Several policy suggestions are included, which are useful for the decision makers of transportation systems' entrepreneurs, the central government, and the local authorities to derive a comprehensive post-HSR planning strategy for a more integrated transportation system.},

abstract = {We have completed a survey of Southern California residents designed to examine whether the details of policy design can make congestion pricing more attractive to the motoring public. A congestion fee proposal is often regarded as simply a tax increase; also, especially in the US, motorists apparently regard the use of congestion fees as coercive, in that they often have few if any practical alternatives to paying the fee. Unlike most opinion surveys on congestion pricing, our survey was quite explicit about the fate of the collected revenues. For example, we presented respondents with policies that returned a substantial portion of the revenues to the public, either in the form of cash (through reductions in sales taxes and vehicle registration fees or through income tax credits) or in the form of coupons to be used for vehicle emissions equipment repair, transit, and the like. In addition, we examined whether the typically intense opposition to congestion pricing if applied only to a part of a roadway, leaving the motorist free to choose between free lanes and toll lanes. We find that a promise to offset the imposition of congestion fees by other taxes can result in a 7{\%} point increase in support for congestion pricing policies, and the restriction of congestion pricing to a single lane on a freeway attracts from 9{\%} to 17{\%} points of additional support.},

Recent research studies investigating social relationships and travel behavior have sought connections between individuals' social networks and socially related travel; however, to the authors' knowledge, no study has pursued the use of online social networking data to do so. This study explores the use of online social network data in characterizing individuals' air travel behavior. Data were collected through a web-based survey including information about individuals' air travel history and online social network information, specifically participants' Facebook networks. The data were then analyzed to address a series of hypotheses about the association between online social network characteristics (specifically Facebook) and air travel behavior, in particular, travel distance, leisure-related travel, and trip generation. This study found a positive relationship between the size and distribution of individuals' Facebook social networks and both their engagement in air travel and the odds that their air travel will be leisure related or will include a leisure component.},

We identify the degree to and conditions under which High-Speed Rail is a viable substitute for airline travel. Using pooled cross-sectional data we estimate multinomial and mixed logit models to examine actual travel behaviour. Our model allows us to analyse the reaction of passenger behaviour on the withdrawal of aviation alternatives and the completion of the High-Speed Rail link between the two cities in November 2007. The results show that travel time and frequency are the main determinants of travel behaviour. The valuation of total travel times changes over the years following the opening of the High-Speed Rail link. Furthermore, we show that the direct elasticity of market share with respect to frequency for a number of aviation alternatives is above 1, indicating that these alternatives are not able to maximise profits. These alternatives subsequently left the market in our sample period. For the remaining aviation alternatives, except for easyJet, we find elasticities of market share with respect to frequency close to 1. Therefore, we conjecture that competition in this market will decline in the long run.},

Through the integration of high-resolution multispectral data (10m) with property tax records for over 100,000 single-family residential parcels in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region, the influence of the size and material composition of residential land use on an indicator of surface heat island formation is reported. In contrast to previous work on the urban heat island, this study derives a parcel-based indicator of surface warming to permit the impact of land use planning regulations governing the density and design of development on the excess surface flux of heat energy to be measured. The results of this study suggest that the contribution of individual land parcels to regional surface heat island formation could be reduced by approximately 40{\%} through the adoption of specific land use planning policies, such as zoning and subdivision regulations, and with no modifications to the size or albedo of the residential structure.},

Linear combinations of independent Gaussian spatial processes are used to develop multivariate spatial processes that are underlying the categorical latent classes. This allows the latent class membership to be correlated across spatially distributed sites and it allows correlation between the probabilities of particular types of classes at any one site. The number of latent classes is assumed fixed but is chosen by model comparison via cross-validation. An application of the spatial latent class analysis model is shown using soil pollution samples where 8 heavy metals were measured to be above or below government pollution limits across a 25 square kilometer region. Estimation is performed within a Bayesian framework using MCMC and is implemented using the OpenBUGS software.},

abstract = {This research study explores the use of an innovative freight tour-based approach to model truck trips as an alternative to the conventional trip-based approach. The tour-based approach is more realistic as it captures the intermediate stops of each truck and reflects the implications of those stops on vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The paper describes the truck tour-based model concept, and presents the framework of a truck tour-based travel demand forecasting approach. As a case study, Global Positioning System (GPS) truck data are used to determine origin, destination, and truck stops for trucks moving within the Birmingham, Alabama region. Such information is then utilized to model truck movements within the study region as individual truck tours. The tour-based model is ran, and the resulting performance measures are contrasted to those obtained from the conventional trip-based planning model used by the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham (RPCGB). This case study demonstrates the feasibility of using a tour-based freight demand forecasting model as an alternative to the conventional 4-step process currently used to estimate truck trips in the Birmingham region. The results and lessons learned from the Birmingham case study are expected to improve truck movement modeling practices in the region and advance the accuracy of truck travel demand forecasting models at other locations in the future.},

This study examined the relationships between features of the neighborhood environment and walking in the neighborhood by U.S. adults. METHODS A random sample of women (n =266) and men (n =208) aged {\textgreater}18 years participated. Door-to-door interviews were conducted in 2003 to collect information about demographics, walking behavior, and features of the neighborhood environment. RESULTS The analyses conducted in 2004 revealed that women were more likely to walk for exercise (odds ratio [OR]=4.6, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=1.01–20.72) or walk a dog (OR=3.3, 95{\%} CI=1.01–11.08) in the neighborhood if neighborhood safety was average as opposed to below average (p {\textless}0.05). Women with an average number of neighborhood destinations were more likely to walk for transportation in the neighborhood (OR=5.7, 95{\%} CI=1.63–19.73) than women with a below average number of neighborhood destinations (p {\textless}0.01). In men, none of the neighborhood features were significantly associated with walking for exercise or walking a dog. Men were less likely to walk for transportation in the neighborhood if the functional (OR=0.22, 95{\%} CI=0.06–0.89) or aesthetic (OR=0.17, 95{\%} CI=0.03–0.89) features of the neighborhood were average versus below average. CONCLUSIONS Prospective studies are needed to determine if changes in neighborhood safety and awareness of neighborhood destinations promote increases in walking by women. Evaluations of the relationships between other environmental features and walking behavior in men are warranted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To assess the relationship between greenspace exposure and childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors. 

STUDY DESIGN
We analyzed data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, an ongoing prospective birth cohort. Greenspace exposure was estimated based on children's addresses using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. Neurobehavioral outcomes were assessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. Regression models adjusted for neighborhood deprivation, maternal education, race, and sex assessed the risk for problematic internalizing and externalizing behaviors at residential greenspace buffers of 200, 400, and 800 m. 

RESULTS
There were 562 and 313 children in our age 7- and 12-year analyses, respectively. At age 7 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with decreased conduct scores ($\beta$ = -1.10, 95{\%} CI [-2.14, -0.06], 200 m). At age 12 years, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with a decrease in anxiety scores ($\beta$ = -1.83, 95{\%} CI [-3.44, -0.22], 800 m), decreased depression scores ($\beta$ = -1.36, 95{\%} CI [-2.61, -0.12], 200 m), and decreased somatization scores ($\beta$ = -1.83, 95{\%} CI [-3.22, -0.44], 200 m). 

CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that increased exposure to residential greenspace is associated with reduced youth's problematic internal and external behaviors, measured by Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, at ages 7 and 12 years. Improved understanding of this mechanism could allow for implementation of neighborhood-level approaches for reducing the risk for childhood behavioral problems.},

abstract = {Planning for affordable housing is challenged by development policies that assess transportation impacts based on methodologies that often do not distinguish between the travel patterns of residents of market-rate housing and those living in affordable units. Given the public goals of providing affordable housing in areas with good accessibility and transportation options, there is a need to reduce unnecessary costs imposed by the potential overestimation of automobile travel and its associated impacts. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to examine and quantify the influences of urban characteristics, residential housing type, and income on metrics commonly used to assess the transportation impacts of new development, namely total home-based trips and home-based vehicle trips. Using the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey, we regressed these metrics on urban place type, regionally adjusted income, and housing type, controlling for household size, weekday travel, and home location. The results indicate significant reductions in vehicle trip making with lower incomes and increasing urbanization. These findings support more differentiation of affordable and market-rate housing in the development review process and emphasize the need for development standards to be more sensitive to the characteristics of future residents and location.},

@article{Habib2008,
abstract = {This paper presents housing price models by using multilevel modeling techniques. The key motivation of using the multilevel modeling technique is that it clearly identifies and differentiates between-cluster heterogeneity (i.e., intrinsic differences across aggregated units) and heterogeneity between units of analysis that are nested within aggregated clusters. Two different specifications are tested: two-level spatial and mixed two-level spatiotemporal random effects models. Whereas the first specification assumes that dwelling units are nested within spatial clusters (i.e., neighborhoods), the second specification hypothesizes that dwelling units are nested within spatiotemporal clusters (neighborhoods in a given time period). The unique contribution of this paper is that it accounts for temporal heterogeneity simultaneously with spatial heterogeneity in the housing price models. The study uses an extensive sample of more than 250,000 housing property transactions in 1987-1995 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada. The paper examines the functional form of the hedonic price model and chooses a semilogarithmic model for subsequent multilevel housing price modeling. The results suggest that the spatiotemporal model performs better in terms of explanatory power and parameter estimates.},

abstract = {Green areas might provide an inviting setting and thereby promote physical activity. The objective of this study was to determine whether moving to different green area surroundings was followed by changes of physical activity. Data from a large population-based cohort of adults in Stockholm County responding to surveys in 2010 and 2014 were analysed (n = 42611). Information about walking/cycling and exercise were self-reported and living area greenness data were satellite-derived (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed separately for changes in levels of walking/cycling and exercise (decrease, stable, increase). Greenness was defined as a change in NDVI quartile to less green, same, or greener. Odds ratio's (OR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were presented adjusted for gender, age, education and area-based income. Contrary to what we hypothesized, those moving to a greener area were more likely to decrease their levels of walking/cycling (OR = 1.42, CI = 1.28–1.58), whereas those moving to a less green area were more likely to increase their walking/cycling (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.13–1.41). Exercise behaviour showed another pattern, with people being more likely to decrease exercise both when moving to a greener (OR = 1.25, CI = 1.22–1.38) and to a less green area (OR = 1.22, CI = 1.09–1.36). Studying subpopulations based on sociodemographic characteristics did not aid to clarify our results. This cohort study with repeated measurements did not support the currently available cross-sectional studies showing a strong positive relation between greenness and physical activity. Nevertheless, our findings have shown spatial patterns related to green areas and physical activity which imply a need for place-specific health policies.},

abstract = {Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5-10 years, and under most conditions within 10-20 years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half - or nearly double them - depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.},

@article{Lamondia2015,
abstract = {In recent years vehicle automation technology has experienced rapid gains. Yet little research has been conducted on self-driving vehicles' potential impacts on long-distance personal travel, which represents a major area of travel growth in the United States. Automated vehicles (AVs) offer flexible trip time and origin-destination pairings at lower (perceived) travel time costs; thus, they have the potential to dramatically change how travelers pursue long-distance tours. By analyzing travel surveys and then developing a statewide simulation experiment of long-distance travel, this paper anticipates AVs' impacts on long-distance travel choices. The research explores Michigan State's 2009 Long-Distance Travel Survey and estimates a long-distance trip generation model and modal-agnostic long-distance mode-choice model. These models were applied in a statewide simulation experiment in which AVs are introduced as a new mode with lower perceived travel time costs (via lowered values of travel time en route) and higher travel costs, (to reflect the initially high price of complete vehicle automation). This experiment highlights the potential shifts in mode choices across different trip distances and purposes. Specifically, for travel under 500 miles, AVs tend to draw from personal vehicles use and airlines equally. Airlines are estimated to remain preferred for distances over 500 miles (e.g. 43.6{\%} of trips greater than 500 miles were by air, and 70.9{\%} of trips greater than 1000 miles were by air).

abstract = {Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.},

abstract = {Elevated summertime temperatures in urban ‘heat islands' increase cooling-energy use and accelerate the formation of urban smog. Except in the city's core areas, summer heat islands are created mainly by the lack of vegetation and by the high solar radiation absorptance by urban surfaces. Analysis of temperature trends for the last 100 years in several large U.S. cities indicate that, since ∼1940, temperatures in urban areas have increased by about 0.5–3.0°C. Typically, electricity demand in cities increases by 2–4{\%} for each 1°C increase in temperature. Hence, we estimate that 5–10{\%} of the current urban electricity demand is spent to cool buildings just to compensate for the increased 0.5–3.0°C in urban temperatures. Downtown Los Angeles (L.A.), for example, is now 2.5°C warmer than in 1920, leading to an increase in electricity demand of 1500 MW. In L.A., smoggy episodes are absent below about 21°C, but smog becomes unacceptable by 32°C. Because of the heat-island effects, a rise in temperature can have significant impacts. Urban trees and high-albedo surfaces can offset or reverse the heat-island effect. Mitigation of urban heat islands can potentially reduce national energy use in air conditioning by 20{\%} and save over {\$}10B per year in energy use and improvement in urban air quality. The albedo of a city may be increased at minimal cost if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roofs and roads. Incentive programs, product labeling, and standards could promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads. Similar incentive-based programs need to be developed for urban trees.},

However, freight transportation capacity is expanding too slowly to keep up with demand, and freight productivity improvements gained through investment in the Interstate highway system and economic deregulation of the freight transportation industry in the 1980s are showing diminishing returns. In Florida, this problem is especially acute, because the population and employment in the state between 2001 and 2030 are expected to grow dramatically. For Florida to maintain its competitiveness in the face of this growth, a good understanding of freight and its impacts on the transportation network is needed.

Approximately one thousand survey participants viewed flashcards of intersection treatments and were asked to identify the proper driving behavior from a list of multiple choices. The answers to the questions were compared in Chi‐squared cross tabulation analysis. The results showed that statistically significant proportions of people incorrectly indicate that right‐turn behavior is similar at standard right‐turn pockets or lanes, yield right‐turn channels, and free right‐turn channels. Men and women were also noted to have statistically different responses. The survey results further indicate that motorists may not distinguish between intersection treatments, prompting better signage and motorist education or the revision of right‐turn delay models for different intersection types.},

METHODS Cross-sectional, hierarchical linear models were used to determine whether park effects were associated with BMI using self-reported height and weight data obtained from the Community Health Survey in New York City (2002–2006). RESULTS Both the proportion of the residential zip code that was large park space and the proportion that was small park space had significant inverse associations with BMI after controlling for individual socio-demographic and zip code built environment characteristics (−0.20 BMI units across the inter-quartile range (IQR) for large parks, 95{\%} CI −0.32, −0.08; −0.21 BMI units across the IQR for small parks, 95{\%} CI −0.31, −0.10, respectively). Poorer scores on the park cleanliness index were associated with higher BMI, 0.18 BMI units across the IQR of the park cleanliness index (95{\%} CI 0.05, 0.30). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that proportion of neighborhoods that was large or small park space and park cleanliness were associated with lower BMI among NYC adults after adjusting for other neighborhood features such as homicides and walkability, characteristics that could influence park usage.},

The model system is designed to address emerging needs to better coordinate transportation and land use planning as a result of recognition of the strong interactions between land use and transportation, increasing pressure from federal transportation and environmental legislation, and growing adoption of state growth management programs. The model system is implemented as a set of interacting model components that represent the major actors and choices in the urban system, including household moving and residential location, business choices of employment location, and developer choices of locations and types of real estate development, all subject to the influence of governmental transportation and land use policy scenarios. The model design is unusual in the degree of disaggregation of space, time, and agents, and in the adoption of a dynamic disequilibrium approach. The objective of this paper is to describe the entire system at a sufficient level of detail to convey the key specification and design choices made in implementing the system.},

abstract = {An accessibility-based approach was used to find the short-term impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) on metropolitan areas. The impacts of Spanish HSR on Madrid from 2006 to 2009 were studied by the integration of geographic information system technology and spatial discrete choice models. Besides the socioeconomic variables, both local and regional transport network development and accessibility growth were consid- ered to isolate the impacts on the changes of land use types brought about by different sources of accessibility. The results from the model reveal that in large metropolitan cities such as Madrid, the impacts of HSR were shadowed by other external factors. With a focus on the land typologies that shifted the land use types during the years studied, the growth of regional accessibility by inauguration of new HSR lines was found to be an important incentive. This growth of regional accessibil- ity may lead to the upgrade of land occupation. However, this finding does not imply that such an increase can be a sufficient factor to drive the change in land use patterns because in a comparison with the whole metropolitan region, the proportion of land cells that changed each year was relatively small.},

Empirical results based on 2004 data from eight domestic US markets indicate that the intensity of the cancellation process is strongly influenced by both the time from ticket purchase and the time before flight departure. Higher cancellations rates are generally observed for recently purchased tickets, and for tickets whose associated flight departure dates are near. Cancellations rates are influenced by several other covariates, including departure day of week, market, and group size.},

@article{Ulrich1991,
abstract = {Different conceptual perspectives converge to predict that if individuals are stressed, an encounter with most unthreatening natural environments will have a stress reducing or restorative influence, whereas many urban environments will hamper recuperation. Hypotheses regarding emotional, attentional and physiological aspects of stress reducing influences of nature are derived from a psycho-evolutionary theory. To investigate these hypotheses, 120 subjects first viewed a stressful movie, and then were exposed to color/sound videotapes of one of six different natural and urban settings. Data concerning stress recovery during the environmental presentations were obtained from self-ratings of affective states and a battery of physiological measures: heart period, muscle tension, skin conductance and pulse transit time, a non-invasive measure that correlates with systolic blood pressure. Findings from the physiological and verbal measures converged to indicate that recovery was faster and more complete when subjects were exposed to natural rather than urban environments. The pattern of physiological findings raised the possibility that responses to nature had a salient parasympathetic nervous system component; however, there was no evidence of pronounced parasympathetic involvement in responses to the urban settings. There were directional differences in cardiac responses to the natural vs urban settings, suggesting that attention/intake was higher during the natural exposures. However, both the stressor film and the nature settings elicited high levels of involuntary or automatic attention, which contradicts the notion that restorative influences of nature stem from involuntary attention or fascination. Findings were consistent with the predictions of the psycho-evolutionary theory that restorative influences of nature involve a shift towards a more positively-toned emotional state, positive changes in physiological activity levels, and that these changes are accompanied by sustained attention/intake. Content differences in terms of natural vs human-made properties appeared decisive in accounting for the differences in recuperation and perceptual intake.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that suburban development is associated with the unbalanced choice of light duty trucks. The specific aspects of the built environment that influence vehicle choice, however, have not been well-established. Further, these studies have not shed much light on the underlying direction of causality: whether neighborhood designs themselves, as opposed to preferences for neighborhood characteristics or attitudes towards travel, more strongly influence individuals' decisions regarding vehicle type. Using a sample from Northern California, this study investigated the relationship between neighborhood design and vehicle type choice, controlling for residential self-selection. Correlation analyses showed that neighborhood design has a strong association with vehicle type choice. Specifically, traditional neighborhood designs are correlated with the choice of passenger cars, while suburban designs are associated with the choice of light duty trucks. The nested logit model suggests that sociodemographic and attitudinal factors play an important role, and that an outdoor spaciousness measure (based on perceptions of yard sizes and off-street parking availability) and commute distance also impact vehicle type choice after controlling for those other influences. This study, therefore, supports the premise that land use policies have at least some potential to reduce the choice of light duty trucks, thereby reducing emissions.},

abstract = {This article proposes a model for analysing the modal choice of travellers making inter-urban journeys. Discrete choice models with systematic and random tastes variation were applied to find the most relevant variables for encouraging the use of public transport by bus rather than private car. This research follows on from the results of previous user satisfaction studies on inter-urban bus services in the province of Burgos (Spain). Willingness to pay is also estimated for time savings or other improvements in the bus service. The results indicate that, in general, improvements in the journey time or the number of daily journeys are valued less by inter-urban bus users than they are by car or railway users. The type of bus and its characteristics are evaluated as a function of the distance travelled and result in very small values for this variable. Contrary to what is often reported in satisfaction surveys, the journey cost is found to be relevant when choosing which mode of transport to use, but the most important variable is journey time. Little value is placed on the features of the bus, except on long distance journeys. Finally, a methodology differentiating four hierarchical groups is presented for comparing the results of the relevant variables in demand and satisfaction models. Some only improve perception rather than encourage new users, while others increase take-up but do not improve the image of the service.},

The growing popularity of carsharing is reflected by a continuous increase in the number of users worldwide. However, the estimation of travel demand for this mode has only sporadically been addressed by researchers and not in a completely satisfactory way. The work reported in this article introduces a new methodology to estimate travel demand for carsharing: activity-based microsimulation. An existing open source software, MATSim, has been enhanced to allow modeling carsharing. This article reports the modeling approach and describes the implementation of the carsharing mode in the system. Some results, based on a simulation scenario with about 160,000 agents representing the urban area of Zurich, Switzerland, are presented and validated against customer data of Mobility Switzerland, the dominant carsharing operator active in the study area.},

In order to quickly and easily examine longitudinal trends in economic and transport metrics -- and thereby validate the model's reasonableness and sensitivity -- we develop an R package swimr to generate plots and interactive maps. The package functions query data from one or more model scenarios and output high-level graphical summaries of the model's complex outputs including: - population and employment - VMT by facility type - trips by mode - trip length frequency distributions - new floorspace constructed by type - floorspace occupied by type - rents by floorspace type - economic output by sector These plots are available to view indexed or absolute values from a single scenario or multiple scenarios, or relative difference in output between two comparison scenarios. Function arguments allow the user to specify the geographic aggregation and scope. Examples of some function outputs are attached to this abstract. Additionally, the package includes RMarkdown templates that can be used to quickly create a comprehensive diagnostic report of a scenario. This report can subsequently be hosted on a website such as at http://52.206.145.100:3838/swim/Reference.html. The plot functions in swimr are designed to give an analyst quick access to high-level summaries of an immense and complex database with only a few commands. Their delivery within an R package (available on GitHub) makes long-term maintenance, extension, and adaptation feasible.},

While the zone system has substantial influence on model results, the resolution and design of zones is rarely analysed systematically, and even less commonly adjusted to a specific modelling need. This paper presents a new methodology to automatically create a new zone system based on the quadtree algorithm specific to transport modelling. Gradual raster cells are generated, where smaller raster cells tend to be used in urban areas and larger raster cells dominate in low-density, rural areas. As changing the zonal resolution affects the number of intra- and interzonal trips, an algorithm has been developed that adjusts intrazonal trips in line with the network resolution. Trip tables of a travel demand model for the state of Geor- gia, USA were disaggregated using this new zone system of gradual raster cells. The traffic assignment results validate significantly better than when using the original zone system.},

abstract = {Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have quickly expanded, with the number of U.S. users doubling every one to two years over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand. The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access available vehicles. This work describes the design of an agent-based model for Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area, with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next. During each 5-minute interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to shorten wait times for next-period travelers. Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns, network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10{\%} more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied versus in-use emissions are assessed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a general random utility framework for analyzing data on individuals' rank-orderings. Specifically, we show that in the case with three alternatives one can express the probability of a particular rank-ordering as a simple function of first choice probabilities. This framework is applied to specify and estimate models of household demand for conventional gasoline cars and alternative fuel vehicles in Shanghai based on rank-ordered data obtained from a stated preference survey. Subsequently, the framework is extended to allow for random effects in the utility specification to allow for intrapersonal correlation in tastes across stated preference questions. The preferred model is then used to calculate demand probabilities and elasticities and the distribution of willingness-to-pay for alternative fuel vehicles.},

abstract = {The causal structure of any system can be analyzed at a multitude of spatial and temporal scales. It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro) descriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a compressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However, recent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that the causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more informative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a system (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the system (the territory). This has been called " causal emergence. " While causal emergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the phenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of the channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity, and that different causal models of those systems take advantage of that capacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale causal models use the full causal capacity. Such macroscale causal models can either be coarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous) in various ways, which can improve the model's efficacy and its informativeness via the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take advantage of an information channel's capacity. As model choice increase, the causal capacity of a system approaches the channel capacity. Ultimately, this provides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some systems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscopic model.},

abstract = {Transport planning relies extensively on forecasts of traveler behavior over horizons of 20 years and more. Implicit in such forecasts is the assumption that travelers' tastes, as represented by the behavioral model parameters, are constant over time. In technical terms, this assumption is referred to as the "temporal transferability" of the models. This paper summarizes the findings from a literature review that demonstrates there is little evidence about the transferability of mode-destination models over typical forecasting horizons. The literature review shows a relative lack of empirical studies given the importance of the issue. To provide further insights and evidence, models of commuter mode-destination choice been developed from household interview data collected across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in 1986, 1996, 2001, and 2006. The analysis demonstrates that improving model specification improves the transferability of the models, and in general the transferability declines as the transfer period increases. The transferability of the level-of-service parameters is higher than transferability of the cost parameters, which has important implications when considering the accuracy of forecasts for different types of policy. The transferred models over-predict the key change in mode share over the transfer period—specifically, the shift from local transit to auto driver between 1986 and 1996—but under-predict the growth in commuting tour lengths over the same period.},

A detailed literature review has been carried out assessing the impacts of HST, which includes reviewing computable general equilibrium models, accessibility and ex-post monitoring studies. Data on economic activity rates, population changes, planning consents and land values are collated and related to changes in accessibility. Detailed case studies are provided for one location with long established HST services for which ex-post analysis is possible (Ashford), and for locations where HST services are being planned, or have recently been opened, and ex-ante analysis can be undertaken (e.g. Stratford and St Pancras, respectively). The case studies show that the wider economic benefits of HST are difficult to detect, as they are swamped by external factors, but they are more likely when large changes in accessibility are complemented by supportive planning policies.

abstract = {Travel modelers commonly use passive transportation-related data, such as cellular or GPS origin-destination matrices, to calibrate or validate their planning models. The passive data are generally used, in this case, to expand and adjust behavioral models estimated from a small-sample local household survey. Recently, there has been interest in deriving synthetic records of individual travel directly from the passive data, with the support of other datasets. Kressner (2017) previously developed a method to build synthetic daily activity and travel patterns for a complete population. In this method, simulated individuals used the 2009 NHTS as a basis for tour patterns while passive origin-destination matrices spatially locate the simulated tours within a specific region. In this work, we update our tour patterns to the 2017 NHTS and comment on observed differences in the resulting simulated travel patterns. Specifically, we consider the temporal distribution of weekday trips. We also examine the consequences of these differences in the synthesized daily schedules and in their traffic assignment. The results show that the NHTS has a similarly high proportion of mid-day, off-peak travel in both 2009 and 2017, and that this proportion is higher than other comparable local household surveys. The results also show that the change from the 2009 to the 2017 dataset does not substantively affect the simulated demand or assignment in a data-driven travel model using NHTS data.},

Calculation of a walk score is widely used in accessibility studies to determine the ease or difficulty of travel by foot between one point and another. The main purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology (Remote Sensing, GIS and Spatial Web Technology) to model urban green space walkability, which enables local residents to make informed decisions that will improve their living conditions and physical health related to the neighbourhood environmental quality. We discuss the modelling of urban green space walkability by utilising web-based Geographical Information System (web-GIS) to calculate eco-friendly walk scores based on the presence of green spaces by integrating Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data and other GIS datasets. We use this spatial web technology to help local residents make decisions related to neighbourhood environmental quality, such as how to choose an eco-friendly living space when buying a home or how to find the shortest or greenest route to walk to improve their health.},

abstract = {The California State Bureau of Automotive Repair uses a high-emitter profile model to direct, or screen a fraction of the vehicle fleet in for inspection and maintenance testing at test-only facilities. Reviews by the California Inspection/Maintenance Review Committee showed the high-emitter profile to be inefficient and in need of improvement. In this study, using in-use vehicle emissions data from California's statewide smog check program, we specified a new multinomial logit model designed to improve the screening efficiency for targeting potential failed and gross polluting vehicles. Modeling results show that factors such as odometer reading, model year, vehicle make, as well as the presence of emissions control systems are significant factors in predicting the likelihood that a screened vehicle will test as a failed or a gross polluting vehicle. Comparisons indicate that the new multinomial logit model specification can predict various inspection/maintenance test outcomes more accurately than the existing high-emitter profile model.},

@article{Mohebbi2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analytic methods commonly used in epidemiology do not account for spatial correlation between observations. In regression analyses, omission of that autocorrelation can bias parameter estimates and yield incorrect standard error estimates.

METHODS: We used age standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) of esophageal cancer (EC) from the Babol cancer registry from 2001 to 2005, and extracted socioeconomic indices from the Statistical Centre of Iran. The following models for SIR were used: (1) Poisson regression with agglomeration-specific nonspatial random effects; (2) Poisson regression with agglomeration-specific spatial random effects. Distance-based and neighbourhood-based autocorrelation structures were used for defining the spatial random effects and a pseudolikelihood approach was applied to estimate model parameters. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and adjusted pseudo R2, were used for model comparison.

RESULTS: A Gaussian semivariogram with an effective range of 225 km best fit spatial autocorrelation in agglomeration-level EC incidence. The Moran's I index was greater than its expected value indicating systematic geographical clustering of EC. The distance-based and neighbourhood-based Poisson regression estimates were generally similar. When residual spatial dependence was modelled, point and interval estimates of covariate effects were different to those obtained from the nonspatial Poisson model.

CONCLUSIONS: The spatial pattern evident in the EC SIR and the observation that point estimates and standard errors differed depending on the modelling approach indicate the importance of accounting for residual spatial correlation in analyses of EC incidence in the Caspian region of Iran. Our results also illustrate that spatial smoothing must be applied with care.},

A two-step, limited information maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to fill this gap. The estimator is developed assuming a Poisson distribution, but can be extended to other count distributions. The small sample properties of the estimator are evaluated with Monte Carlo experiments. Simulation results suggest that the spatial lag count estimator achieves gains in terms of bias over the aspatial version as spatial lag autocorrelation and sample size increase. An empirical example deals with the location choice of single-unit start-up firms in the manufacturing industry in the US between 2000 and 2004. The empirical results suggest that in the dynamic process of firm formation, counties dominated by firms exhibiting internal increasing returns to scale are at a relative disadvantage even if localization economies are present. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

@article{Friedrich2010,
abstract = {The core of this paper presents a method for generating O-D matrices by using floating phone data (FPD), that is, data of mobile phones moving through a study area. Mobile phones signals recorded in the cellular phone network are used to derive time-space trajectories of moving mobile phone devices. The start and end point of each trajec-tory determine the origin and destination zone. Then link counts are used to project the sample of mobile phone movements to the entire movements of cars, trucks, and rail passengers. Because travel patterns vary from day to day, O-D matrices are merged to typical traffic days, which are determined on the basis of clustered traffic counts from roadside detectors. This finally provides a set of O-D matrices of typical traffic days for planning purposes. The data set used in this paper was recorded in the cellular phone network of T-Mobile in a study area of 100 × 100 km in southwest Germany (Figure 1). It covers a time period of almost 70 days. The method uses data mainly from location-area updates, which are recorded from any mobile phone in standby mode, and thus does not require phone calls. This permits observing entire trips from their origin to their destination and not just trip segments covered by a single phone call. The signals produced by a particular mobile phone can be tracked because each phone possesses a unique anonymous identification (ID). This ID is modified every 24 h at midnight. Therefore it is not possible to track a single phone during a longer period. Considering these limitations, the method presented in this paper permits the generation of O-D matrices for • Typical day types; • Passenger car, truck, and passenger rail modes; and • A zoning system in which the zone size complies with the location areas of the cellular phone network. METHODOLOGY The method for generating O-D matrices from mobile phone data uses three main data sources as input: • Network model containing the relevant road and rail infrastructure and the position of count locations; • Load curves of traffic volumes in 15-min intervals from count locations in the road network (cars, trucks) and in the rail network (passengers); and • Trajectories from FPD-the method for generating such trajec-tories from FPD is described in Friedrich et al. (3) and Schlaich et al. (4). The spatial course of a trajectory is described by an origin zone, destination zone, and sequence of network links. Temporal information is available for each location update, that is, approximately every 5 to 15 min. A trajectory belongs to one mode of transport. This paper presents a method for generating origin-destination (O-D) matrices with the use of floating phone data, that is, data generated from mobile phones moving through a study area. Mobile phone signals recorded in the cellular phone network are used to derive time-space tra-jectories of moving mobile phone devices. The start and end points of each trajectory determine the origin and destination zone. Link counts are used to project the sample of mobile phone movements to the broader movement of cars, trucks, and rail passengers. With results of a clustering process of traffic counts, O-D matrices for typical traffic days are computed. The resulting O-D matrices can be used for a long-term traffic state forecast. The knowledge of travel demand is essential for planning and operating the transport supply. Origin-destination (O-D) matrices contain information on the travel demand in a study area in condensed form. Each matrix element quantifies the number of movements between an origin and a destination zone. The movements can refer to the aggregated travel demand of all travelers in a specific time interval or to more disaggregated levels in which the movements describe the travel demand of a particular mode, trip purpose, or person group. Travel surveys guaranteeing statistically ascertained values for the number of movements on the level of O-D pairs require a large sample size. For that reason and because it is difficult to observe all movements in a study area, O-D matrices are usually generated by using a travel demand model. In traditional travel demand modeling following the four-stage approach, O-D matrices result from the trip distribution and the mode choice step. The mode-specific O-D matrices then provide the input for the traffic assignment step. For calibrating the parameters of the trip distribution model it is common to compare modeled trip time distributions in the network with observed trip time distributions from household trip diary surveys. After the assignment, the modeled traffic volumes can be compared with observed traffic count volumes on the link level. Occasionally matrix correction or matrix update techniques are applied after assignment to produce a corrected travel demand matrix from a base matrix by using traffic count values. Willumsen (1) and Van Zuylen and Willumsen (2) describe such a method for a matrix correction based on the entropy maximization approach.},

abstract = {High-speed rail is seen as a factor contributing to the attractiveness of a location for economic activities. This paper focuses on how the level-of-service characteristics of railway stations, and in particular the presence of high-speed train services, influence the attractiveness of locations for specific types of offices. The results are presented for a stated choice experiment for location choices of offices in the Netherlands. It is concluded that the availability of high-speed train services contributes to the attractiveness of a location for offices. For internationally-oriented offices the areas around stations with international high-speed train services are attractive because of their good international accessibility. We also found an indication that high-speed train services can raise the status of an office site. In the Netherlands, the domestic high-speed train services are less relevant for location choices, because of the small domestic distances. Besides high-speed train services, other location characteristics that determine how well a site is connected to the railway network are also found to be important for location choices. Thereby differences between offices occur, which can partly be explained by the number of trips to/from an office.},

Southeast Toronto, the study area, includes 334 EAs and covers 16 km(2) of urban area. We used hospital admission diagnostic codes from 1990 to 1992 to measure respiratory and genitourinary conditions. We assessed the effect of EA exposure on hospital admissions using a Poisson mixed-effects model and examined the spatial distributions of variables. Exposure to PM(2.5) has a significant effect on admission rates for a subset of respiratory diagnoses (asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection), with a relative risk of 1.24 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.05-1.45) for a log(10) increase in exposure. We noted a weaker effect of exposure on hospitalization for all respiratory conditions, and no effect on hospitalization for nonrespiratory conditions.},

The modelling framework is applied to the city of Boston to assess the impact of the subway system on single-family property values and gauge the potential for value capture. We find that failing to correct for sample selection and spatial autocorrelation results in significant bias in valuing transit accessibility.

We examine gentrification's association with neighborhood rates of poor self-rated physical health. We contextualize this relationship by evaluating gentrification's relation with city-level self-rated health inequalities. We find gentrification was significantly and positively related with self-rated physical neighborhood health outcomes. However, the presence and magnitude of gentrification within a city was not associated with health outcomes for cities overall. Based on these findings, we argue that gentrification's health benefits for cities are limited at best, though gentrification does not appear to be associated with deepening city-level health inequalities, either.},

Important findings in the analysis are (i) the number of licensed drivers is the primary determinant of the number of automobiles owned, (ii) the presence of children is not a significant factor in automobile ownership and VMT, and (iii) the VMT of multi-vehicle households is more sensitive to transit than one-vehicle households.

An important contribution of this{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}research is the introduction of a transit accessibility variable, which is{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}defined as {\$}TA{\_}i = 1/\backslashsqrt{\{}D{\_}i{\}}{\$} where {\$}D{\$} is the distance to transit.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}

        {\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}The authors find that good transit infrastructure is correlated with having{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}lower levels of automobile ownership, though this effect is more significant in{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}some areas than in others. Examining the marginal effects of the different{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}variables on automobile ownership, they found that the number of drivers in a{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}home the single strongest factor on the number of automobiles owned. This effect{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}was about twelve times stronger than the number of workers, and about four times{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}stronger than the household size.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}

        {\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}Another unique aspect of this paper is the simulation component: the authors{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}tested what would happen to automobile ownership if a transit station were{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}provided within a certain maximum distance of all individuals within certain{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}sized districts. They predict that expanding transit accessiblity can reduce VMT{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}by up to 11$\backslash${\%} from the base, with a 9$\backslash${\%} reduction in automobile ownership and{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}average miles per vehicle reduced by 3$\backslash${\%}.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}

        {\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}This is a fascinating study. The authors identify future research directions,{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}including the desire to incorporate transit service, such as comfort, cost and{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}timeliness, into the models. A principle concern that I have about this study is{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}that it is now seven years old, using data from when I was in elementary school.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}Sustained gas prices have more than tripled since then, and the housing boom{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}exploded suburbs in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Dallas. Using the Equifax data to do{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}this sort of analysis is certainly possible, and would be a very interesting{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}comparison.

This paper focuses on big intermediate cities along HSR lines, develops a multilevel analysis at national, regional and local levels and examines HSR's selective capacity to transform time distances and accessibility. The paper draws together data which make clear how HSR opens up new opportunities for these big intermediate cities. Specifically, it analyses three particular cases: C{\'{o}}rdoba and Zaragoza in Spain and Lille in France. This case-study approach, taking account of specific circumstances and contexts, facilitates the understanding of the similarities and differences in HSR's impact on urban and territorial development. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban green space, such as parks, forests, green roofs, streams, and community gardens, provides critical ecosystem services. Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are ‘just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability.},

The study captures the state of the practice among agencies of different sizes, geographic locations, and modes and evaluates the opportunities for and challenges of conducting surveys in an era of emerging technologies. The study presents a literature review and results of a survey of transit agencies that conduct all different types of rider surveys. Fifty-seven completed responses were received from the 67 agencies in the survey sample, a response rate of 86 percent. Case examples of five transit systems are provided; these present an in-depth analysis of various survey strategies and include two agencies that have leveraged passive data to complement or eliminate origin–destination surveys. This synthesis will assist all transit agencies that conduct origin–destination surveys; the report presents the reality and complexity of conducting this type of survey and will allow agencies to compare what they are currently doing with what others are doing, get ideas about what other strategies are possible, and make better decisions about surveying in the future.},

Nearly all of this work is done in the univariate case and employs an improper specification. Our contribution here is to move to multivariate conditional autoregressive models and to provide rich, flexible classes which yield proper distributions. Our approach is to introduce spatial autoregression parameters. We first clarify what classes can be developed from the family of Mardia (1988) and contrast with recent work of Kim et al. (2000). We then present a novel parametric linear transformation which provides an extension with attractive interpretation. We propose to employ these models as specifications for second-stage spatial effects in hierarchical models. Two applications are discussed; one for the two-dimensional case modelling spatial patterns of child growth, the other for a four-dimensional situation modelling spatial variation in HLA-B allele frequencies. In each case, full Bayesian inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.},

abstract = {Many metropolitan areas in the United States use vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs as a means of identifying high-polluting vehicles. While the eectiveness of such programs is debatable, the cost is undeniable, with millions of dollars spent in testing and millions more lost in the time motorists expend to participate in such programs. At the core of these costs is the blanket approach of requiring all vehicles to be tested. This paper sets the groundwork for a procedure that can be used to selectively target those vehicles most likely to be pollution violators. Using I/M data collected in the Seattle area in 1994, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon emissions were modeled simultaneously using three- stage least squares. Our results show that vehicle age, vehicle manufacturer, number of engine cylinders, odometer reading, and whether or not oxygenated fuels were in use all play a signi{\textregistered}cant role in determining I/M emission test results and these statistical {\textregistered}ndings can be used to form the basis for the selective sampling of vehicles for I/M testing.},

abstract = {Choice-based samples oversample infrequently chosen alternatives to obtain an effective representation of the behavior of people who select these alternatives. However, the use of choice-based samples requires recognition of the sampling process in formulating the estimation procedure. In general, this procedure can be accomplished by applying weights to the observed choices in the estimation process. Unfortunately, the use of such weighted estimation procedures for choice models does not yield efficient estimators. However, for the special case of the multinomial logit model with a full set of alternative-specific constants, the standard maximum likelihood estimator—which is efficient—can be used with adjustment of the alternative-specific constants. The same maximum likelihood estimator can also be used with adjustment to estimate nested logit models with choice-based samples. The proof of this property is qualitatively described, and examples demonstrate how to apply the adjustment procedure.},

abstract = {In this paper, we formulate and estimate a nested model structure that includes a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) component to analyze the choice of vehicle type/vintage and usage in the upper level and a multinomial logit (MNL) component to analyze the choice of vehicle make/model in the lower nest. Data for the analysis are drawn from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Travel Survey. The model results indicate the important effects of household demographics, household location characteristics, built environment attributes, household head characteristics, and vehicle attributes on household vehicle holdings and use. The model developed in the paper is applied to predict the impact of land-use and fuel cost changes on vehicle holdings and usage of the households. Such predictions can inform the design of proactive land-use, economic, and transportation policies to influence household vehicle holdings and usage in a way that reduces the negative impacts of automobile dependency such as traffic congestion, fuel consumption and air pollution.},

abstract = {The impact of landmark designation on prices of the property and its neighbors sits at the core of the policy debate and empirical research on historic preservation. Yet these studies suffer from serious methodological limitations and biases. First, as important unobserved characteristics likely correlate with landmark designation, an omitted-variable bias results. Second, if designations depend on property values or neighborhood housing market conditions, the endogenous selection process further undermines inferences about preservation policies' effects. This article outlines more robust empirical strategies and presents new evidence on landmark designation effects on property values. For a sample of Chicago home sales during the 1990s, a hedonic price analysis suggests that landmark buildings and districts sell at a small premium. To address the omitted-variable bias, a repeat-sales approach demonstrates significant spillover effects of landmark designation on prices. These estimates are also robust to sample-selection bias and some forms of spatial autocorrelation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study is to examine whether adolescents' road safety perception (RSP) acts as a mediator on the association between the distance from home to the nearest park and the use of the parks for physical activity (PA). 

STUDY DESIGN
This is a cross-sectional study. 

METHODS
The evaluation was through a random sample of 1130 adolescents (534 male), corresponding to 47.3{\%}, 14–20 years old, from Porto Alegre, Brazil. RSP was assessed through some questions of the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for Youth. Park use, socioeconomic status, age, and sex were measured using a questionnaire. Distance from home to the nearest park was evaluated through geographic information system. Data analysis was performed using Pearson correlation, and linear regression models were fitted as per the Baron and Kenny procedures for mediation analyses. All analyses were adjusted for sex and socioeconomic status. 

RESULTS
Road safety perception is independently associated with less distance from home to the nearest park (P = 0.04) and use of the parks for PA (P = 0.02). Road safety perception is a mediator and explains 16{\%} of the association between park use and distance from home to the park (indirect Effect = −40.9966; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 119.3733–2.2455). 

CONCLUSION
Our findings indicated that RSP is a mediator on the association between the distance from home to the nearest park and the use of the parks for PA. Future studies should take this into consideration frequency and intensity of PA and other environmental characteristics, such as crime, aesthetics, and neighborhood facilities.},

abstract = {This paper explores the association of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics on the odds of being overweight and obese using data from the Atlanta SMARTRAQ travel survey. A new methodological framework based on a multinomial logit (MNL) model and an enhanced odds ratio plot is presented. The use of an MNL model overcomes limitations of many prior studies that employ a sequence of binary logit models to examine multiple weight categories. The use of an enhanced odds ratio plot provides important information into the relative importance of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics. Several new findings for the Atlanta area result from this study. Socio-demographic variables, including age and educational attainment, exhibit a non-linear relationship with the odds of being overweight or obese. Gender, age, ethnicity, and educational attainment are strongly associated with the odds of being overweight or obese, while income and number of students between 5 and 16 years old in the household have smaller effects. Built environment characteristics such as increased net residential densities and enhanced street connectivity are associated with reductions in the odds of being overweight and/or obese. Relative to socio-demographic variables, however, such built environment characteristics have a much smaller impact on describing the odds of being overweight or obese.},

This paper proposes an activity-based freight modeling framework and discuses its data needs. The framework consists of five modules: firm generation, supply chain replication, shipment forecasting, logistic decisions, and network analysis. Similar to the activity-based approach in the passenger travel modeling, in which individuals or households are the agents of the models, individual firms or a group of firms with similar characteristics, are the main players in the proposed framework. Public data sources that could be used in the U.S. to make this framework running are also introduced and a supplementary establishment survey is proposed as a cost-effective way to satisfy the data needs of the framework.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
A lack of comprehensive and standardized metrics for measuring park exposure limits park-related research and health promotion efforts. This study aimed to develop and demonstrate an empirically-derived and spatially-represented index of park access (ParkIndex) that would allow researchers, planners, and citizens to evaluate the potential for park use for a given area. 

METHODS
Data used for developing ParkIndex were collected in 2010 in Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO). Adult study participants (n=891) reported whether they used a park within the past month, and all parks in KCMO were mapped and audited using ArcGIS 9.3 and the Community Park Audit Tool. Four park summary variables — distance to nearest park, and the number of parks, amount of park space, and average park quality index within 1mile were analyzed in relation to park use using logistic regression. Coefficients for significant park summary variables were used to create a raster surface (ParkIndex) representing the probability of park use for all 100m×100m cells in KCMO. 

RESULTS
Two park summary variables were positively associated with park use — the number of parks and the average park quality index within 1 mile. The ParkIndex probability of park use across all cells in KCMO ranged from 17 to 77 out of 100. 

CONCLUSION
ParkIndex represents a standardized metric of park access that combines elements of both park availability and quality, which was developed empirically and can be represented spatially. This tool has both practical and conceptual significance for researchers and professionals in diverse disciplines.},

For various reasons, a simple correlation between unaffordable housing and employment growth cannot be interpreted as causal. Several empirical strategies are employed to identify the causal effect of unaffordable housing on employment growth.

abstract = {Many U.S. cities use vehicle emissions testing programs to improve air quality by identifying gross polluting vehicles and requiring their owners to make emissions-related repairs. All vehicles that meet certain criteria must pass an emissions test as part of the vehicle registration process. States use different criteria to determine which vehicles must be tested; however, the equity impacts associated with various screening criteria are unknown. This is due to difficulties researchers have faced in linking vehicle and household characteristics. We investigate the relative influence of vehicle and household characteristics on emissions failures in Atlanta, Georgia, by linking its emissions testing database to a targeted marketing database; the latter contains information about vehicle owners. We use count and hurdle models to predict vehicle emissions failures. Our model finds a relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failure after controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical vehicles, the one owned by low-income or minority households is more likely to fail emissions. We use our model to investigate the impacts of different emissions testing policies by income and ethnic groups.},

abstract = {Empirical studies on household car ownership have used two types of discrete choice modeling structures: ordered and unordered. In ordered response structures, such as the ordered logit and ordered probit models, the choice of the number of household vehicles arises from a unidimensional latent variable that reflects the propensity of a household to own vehicles. Unordered response structures are based on the random utility maximization principle, which assumes a household associates a utility value across different car ownership levels and chooses the one with the maximum utility. The most common unordered response models are the multinomial logit and probit models, but only the multinomial logit has been used in practical applications because of its simple structure and low computational requirements. Consensus among researchers on unordered or ordered structures is still lacking. Empirical studies have reported various models, including the multinomial logit, ordered logit, and ordered probit. An open question remains: Which model would better reflect households' car ownership choices? This paper compares multinomial logit, ordered logit, and ordered probit car ownership models through a number of formal evaluation measures and empirical analysis of three data sets: the 2001 National Household Travel Survey for the Baltimore [Maryland] Metropolitan Area, the 2005 Dutch National Travel Survey, and the 2000 Osaka [Japan] Metropolitan Person Trip Data. Results show the multinomial logit model should be selected for modeling the level of household car ownership.},

If so, contact with nature, which appears to mitigate mental fatigue, may reduce aggression and violence. This study investigated that possibility in a setting and population with relatively high rates of aggression: inner-city urban public housing residents. Levels of aggression were compared for 145 urban public housing residents randomly assigned to buildings with varying levels of nearby nature (trees and grass). Attentional functioning was assessed as an index of mental fatigue. Residents living in relatively barren buildings reported more aggression and violence than did their counterparts in greener buildings. Moreover, levels of mental fatigue were higher in barren buildings, and aggression accompanied mental fatigue. Tests for the proposed mechanism and for alternative mechanisms indicated that the relationship between nearby nature and aggression was fully mediated thro...},

A stated choice heteroskedastic extreme value switching model is used to evaluate the choice of fare type for business and non-business travel given the current mode used in the corridor for each sampled traveller conventional train, charter coach, scheduled coach, plane or car. Starting with the current travel profile, patronage can be predicted under alternative fare regimes, taking into account diverted traffic, induced traffic and growth.

From these sources, the paper identifies major challenges in integrated land-use/transport modeling and proposes paths that support successful implementations. Particular attention is given to the coordination of short- and long-term decisions, the technical integration of models, microscopic versus macroscopic frameworks and appropriate levels of model complexity. The paper concludes with five themes that require further research to ensure that integrated land-use/transport models will keep up with modeling needs in the future.},

Other studies, however, have shown that urban residential areas with well-maintained vegetation experience lower rates of certain crime types due to increased surveillance in vegetated spaces as well as the therapeutic effects ascribed to vegetated landscapes. The present research analyzes the association of vegetation with crime in a case study of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We examine rates of assaults, robberies, burglaries, and thefts in relation to remotely sensed vegetation abundance at the Census tract level. We employ choropleth mapping, correlation, ordinary least squares regression, and spatial econometric modeling to examine the influence of vegetation on various crime types while controlling for tract-level socioeconomic indicators. Results indicate that vegetation abundance is significantly associated with lower rates of assault, robbery, and burglary, but not theft. This research has implications for urban planning policy, especially as cities are moving towards ‘green' growth plans and must look to incorporate sustainable methods of crime prevention into city planning.},

abstract = {This is the first study to empirically examine the relationship between building sustainability features and performance of corresponding commercial mortgages across property types. We examine 22,813 loans in the CMBS universe and more than 664,000 quarterly observations of loan performance. Two types of sustainability features are considered: smart growth locations that are walkable, transit- oriented, near green infrastructure, or avoid traffic-related air pollution; and green buildings, including LEED and Energy Star properties. We find that several sustainability features are strongly associated with lower default risk after controlling for standard risk factors. The mortgage default risk of buildings within a quarter mile of fixed-rail transit stations is reduced by 30.1 percent compared to other locations, properties with a Walk Score of 77 (out of 100) have a 13.5 percent lower default risk than properties with a Walk Score of 45, Energy Star properties are 20 percent less likely to default than others and properties near protected open space are 3 percent less likely to default, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, some sustainability features are associated with increased default risk, including jobs-worker balance (for office and retail) and locations that avoid traffic-related air pollution (for office and multifamily housing), suggesting that market signals can conflict with sustainability goals. The results for green infrastructure are ambiguous. We also find the default model fits the data better when sustainability variables are included. When examined by property type we find that walkability has the most consistent benefit to default risk across property types, followed by transit and energy efficiency. Our results will be of interest to academics, professionals, and policy makers because they give new insights into the geography of default risk, new ways for lenders and debt investors to predict and manage risk, and a better understanding of the financial dynamics that support and deter sustainable urbanism.},

By-person factor analysis revealed four dis- tinct preference segments for middle-distance travel: (1) choice travellers with a preference for public transport, (2) deliberate-choice travellers, (3) choice travellers with car as dominant alternative, and (4) car-dependent travellers. These preference segments differ in terms of the levels of involvement and cognitive effort in travel decision making, the travel consideration-set and underlying motivations. The study showed that for most people there is more to travel than getting from point A to point B, and that there is considerable heterogeneity in middle-distance travel preferences. Policy implications for reducing the need for travel and promoting a modal shift from car to other travel modes are discussed.},

abstract = {Regional travel models in the United States are clearly evolving from conventional models towards a new generation of more behaviorally realistic activity-based models. The new generation of regional travel demand models is characterized by three features: (1) an activity-based platform, that implies that modeled travel be derived within a general framework of the daily activities undertaken by households and persons, (2) a tour-based structure of travel where the tour is used as the basic unit of modeling travel instead of the elemental trip, and (3) micro-simulation modeling techniques that are applied at the fully-disaggregate level of persons and households, which convert activity and travel related choices from fractional-probability model outcomes into a series of discrete or “crisp” decisions. While the new generation of model has obvious conceptual advantages over the conventional four-step models, there are still numerous technical issues that have to be addressed as well as a better understanding of practical benefits should be achieved before the new generation of models can fully replace conventional models. The paper summarizes the recent successful experience in the development and application of activity-based demand models for Metropolitan Planning Organizations in the US. Moving activity-based approaches into practice is analyzed in a broad context of travel demand modeling market tendencies and policy implications.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t To mitigate the congestion caused by the ever increasing number of privately owned auto-mobiles, public transit is highly promoted by transportation agencies worldwide. A better understanding of travel patterns and regularity at the ''magnitude'' level will enable transit authorities to evaluate the services they offer, adjust marketing strategies, retain loyal cus-tomers and improve overall transit performance. However, it is fairly challenging to iden-tify travel patterns for individual transit riders in a large dataset. This paper proposes an efficient and effective data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit rid-ers in Beijing, China. Transit riders' trip chains are identified based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of their smart card transaction data. The Density-based Spatial Clus-tering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm then analyzes the identified trip chains to detect transit riders' historical travel patternsand the K-Means++ clustering algo-rithm and the rough-set theory are jointly applied to cluster and classify travel pattern reg-ularities. The performance of the rough-set-based algorithm is compared with those of other prevailing classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed rough-set-based algorithm outperforms other commonly used data-mining algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The application of disaggregate models for predictions and policy evaluations requires as inputs detailed information on the socioeconomic characteristics of the population. The early procedure developed for population synthesis involved the generation of a joint multiway distribution of all attributes of interest using iterative proportional fitting (IPF). Recognizing its limitations, including the inability to deal with multilevel controls, several alternate methods have been proposed in the last few years. This article presents a methodology called the fitness-based synthesis (FBS) that directly generates a list of households to match several multilevel controls without the need for determining a joint multiway distribution. The application and validation results demonstrate both the feasibility of the approach and its improved performance relative to the IPF and methods using fewer control tables. This article also presents a comprehensive validation of the synthetic populations against the true populations and thereby demonstrates the ability of the FBS method to generate the multidimensional correlations among the attributes. The number of iterations to terminations is found to be between one and three times the number of households to be synthesized. In sum, the FBS is an efficient and scalable methodology that is easy to implement and as such is a valuable tool for generating the detailed socioeconomic characteristics need for applying disaggregate travel-demand forecasting models.},

These services are collecting unprecedented amounts of big data that can be used to study how we travel and interact with our environment. This paper presents the development of a long distance destination choice model for Ontario, Canada, using data from Foursquare to model destination attractiveness. A methodology to collect and process historical check-in counts has been developed, allowing the utility of each destination to be calculated based on the intensity of different activities performed at the destination. Destinations such as national parks and ski areas are very strong attractors of leisure trips, yet do not employ many people and have few residents. Trip counts to such destinations are therefore poorly predicted by models based on population and employment. Traditionally, this has been remedied by extensive manual data collection. The integration of Foursquare data offers an alternative approach to this problem. The Foursquare based destination choice model was evaluated against a traditional model estimated only with population and employment. The results demonstrate that data from LBSNs can be used to improve destination choice models, particularly for leisure travel. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Service on the Svealand line is operated with regional high-speed trains. In a case study of the effects of regional high-speed train services, changes in knowledge, valuations and travel behaviour have been analysed. The Svealand line has sparked an increase in regional rail travel of up to seven times compared to the old railway between Eskilstuna and Stockholm. Additionally, the market share has risen from 6{\%} to 30{\%}. Travelling times are valued highly and motorists, particularly, place great value on the high-speed train mode of transport.A general conclusion is that regional high-speed train services have had a major impact on the travel market and on travel behaviour. The improved accessibility to Stockholm, in particular, is especially noticeable among residents living close to the railway stations.},

@article{Tailor2019,
abstract = {PURPOSE
Spatial access to health care resources is a requisite for utilization. Our purpose was to determine, at a census tract level, the geographic distribution of US smokers and their driving distance to an ACR-accredited CT facility. 

METHODS
The number of smokers per US census tract was determined from US Census Bureau data (American Community Survey, 2011-2015) and census tract smoking prevalence estimates. Driving distance, from the centroid of each census tract to the nearest CT facility, was determined using a geographic information system. Distance variations were assessed, and relationships with tract population density were examined with regression models. 

RESULTS
Most US smokers (81.8{\%}) were within 15 miles of a CT facility; however, there was considerable inter- and intrastate variability. For census tracts containing ≥500 smokers, median distance to a CT was 4.3 miles. At the state level, median distance ranged from 1.4 (Washington DC) to 29.1 miles (Wyoming). Within each state, this variation was higher, with Washington, DC, exhibiting the lowest range (range, 4.3; 0.2-4.5 miles) and Maine exhibiting the highest range (range, 244.8; 0.2-245.0 miles). Distance to a CT facility was inversely associated with census tract population density. 

CONCLUSIONS
Geographic variability in CT facility access has implications for lung cancer screening (LCS) implementation. Individuals in densely populated areas have relatively greater spatial access to CT facilities than those in sparsely populated tracts. Further work is needed to identify access disparities to LCS to optimize LCS for all eligible populations.},

This estimation approach, inspired by methods used in revenue management, is applied to a multinomial logit model that has a full set of identifiable alternative specific constants. Parameter estimates are found by combining disaggregate data (obtained from a random or exogenous sample) with aggregate observations of market shares for the observed choices. The method provides an estimate of the market share for the alternative that was not observed to be chosen in the estimation dataset. This is significant, as it suggests that the transportation community can forecast demand for a new alternative or demand for alternatives that are expensive to collect via intercept surveys without having observations for individuals who have chosen these alternatives. Our methodology can be extended to other generalized extreme value models.},

abstract = {Household vehicle ownership and fleet composition are choice dimensions that have important implications for policy making, particularly in the energy and environmental sustainability arena. In the context of household vehicle ownership and type choice, it is conceivable that there are substantial spatial interaction effects due to both observed and unobserved factors. This paper presents a multinomial probit model formulation that incorporates spatial spillover effects arising from both observed and unobserved factors. The model is capable of endogenously estimating the number of vehicles of each type that a household acquires by using a synthetic choice occasion approach where households are assumed to purchase vehicles over a series of choice occasions. The model is estimated on the California add-on data set of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. Model estimation results show that spatial dependency effects are statistically significant. The findings have important implications for model development and application in the policy forecasting arena.},

Sixty-four urban public housing outdoor spaces (27 low vegetation, 37 high vegetation) were observed on four separate occasions. Overall, inner-city children's everyday activities and access to adults appeared remarkably healthy; of the 262 children observed, most (73{\%}) were involved in some type of play, and most groups of children (87{\%}) were supervised to some degree. In relatively barren spaces, however, the picture was considerably less optimistic: Levels of play and access to adults were approximately half as much as those found in spaces with more trees and grass, and the incidence of creative play was significantly lower in barren spaces than in relatively green spaces.},

@article{Rahman2016,
abstract = {One of the fundamental components of transit planning is understand-ing passenger demand, which is commonly represented with origin– destination (O-D) matrices. However, manual collection of detailed O-D information through surveys can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, data from automated fare collection systems, such as smart cards, often include only entry information without tracking where pas-sengers exit the transit network. New mobile ticketing systems offer the opportunity to prompt riders about their specific trips when they purchase a ticket, and this information can be used to track O-D patterns during the ticket activation phase. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use back-end mobile ticketing data to generate passenger O-D matri-ces and compare the outcome with O-D matrices generated with tradi-tional onboard surveys. Iterative proportional fitting was used to create O-D matrices with both mobile ticketing and onboard survey data. These matrices were compared using Euclidean distance calculations. This work was done for the East River Ferry in New York City, and the results show that during peak periods, mobile ticketing data closely match survey data. However, in the off-peak period and during week-ends, when travelers are more likely to be noncommuters and tourists, matrices developed from mobile ticketing and survey data have greater differences. The impact of occasional riders making noncommute trips is the likely cause for these differences, because commuters are familiar with using the mobile ticketing product and occasional riders are more likely to use paper tickets on the ferry service. Urban ferry service plays an important role in the transit network in New York. The New York City Economic Development Cor-poration (NYCEDC) manages the East River Ferry (ERF), a pri-vately operated ferry route connecting Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens in New York City. According to NYCEDC, the eight-stop route carried 1.3 million passengers in 2014. The ferry service was launched as a 3-year pilot in 2011 and became a permanent service in 2014 because of high ridership and extensive public sup-port. During its pilot phase in 2012, the ERF became the first urban transit service in the United States to launch a mobile application for fare payment (1). This mobile ticketing application, or app, allows passengers to buy tickets directly on their smartphones with a credit or debit card (2). This new mobile ticketing system creates a rich source of data about where and when passengers use the ferry ser-vice. The purpose of this study is to conduct an exploratory analysis of this back-end mobile ticketing data in an anonymized format to assess its potential for planning and operations applications. Specifi-cally, this project aims to assess if mobile ticketing data can be used to create origin–destination (O-D) matrices, which are fundamental to transit planning. Prior research This section provides a brief review of relevant prior research. First, a short summary of literature pertaining to O-D estimation with data from automated fare collection (AFC) systems is pre-sented, and then a recent study about AFC data from a ferry service is discussed. AFC systems, such as those with smart cards, provide vast quan-tities of data about where and when passengers travel on transit systems. These data can be used for transportation planning in many different ways (3). One common use of smart card data is for esti-mation of transit passenger O-D matrices (4–10). However, one of the primary challenges in O-D estimation with smart card data is that most transit systems only require the passenger to tap in with their smart card, which means that only origin information is collected and destinations must be inferred (11). Therefore, opportunities for improved data sets exist when new fare collection systems collect both the origin and destination of transit passengers. Although AFC systems are common in urban bus and rail sys-tems, they are infrequently used on ferry services. However, one recent study of a linear urban ferry service in Brisbane, Australia, investigated the travel behavior of passengers with more than a mil-lion smart card records over a 6-month period (12). This large data set included numerous variables, such as the date and time of the trip, trip ID, route direction, boarding stop ID, and alighting stop ID. The results of the analysis showed aggregate-level trends in travel behavior; however, the authors did not use the data set to estimate O-D matrices for the ferry service. In summary, there is a large body of literature pertaining to the use of AFC data for transit planning, especially O-D estimation. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the prior studies has used data from new mobile ticketing systems, which are capable of collecting both origin and destination information. Moreover, there are few prior studies that use new data sources from urban ferry services. This research aims to help fill these gaps in the literature. objective New mobile ticketing systems have the potential to provide large amounts of automatically collected data about passenger travel pat-terns. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use back-end mobile ticketing data to create transit passenger O-D matrices for a single ferry route in New York City. To assess the validity of the mobile ticketing data, the data are compared with the results of an onboard O-D survey. Both data sets are used to create seed matrices, which are then expanded with iterative proportional fitting (IPF). The mobile ticketing O-D matrices are then compared with the survey data with Euclidean distance. Finally, a brief analysis is conducted to identify the pattern of travel behavior of the ferry users. background},

abstract = {Over the past few years many travel demand modelers have come to the realization that their static traffic assignment algorithm is inadequate. As the demand portion of our models become more sophisticated, we are able to confidently model and compare many policy scenarios. Embarrassingly, within the limits of static traffic assignment we cannot calculate such simple measures as travel time between an origin and destination without a string of caveats attached. Nor can we provide volume-to- capacity ratios that traffic engineers won't laugh at. Unfortunately, many of these simple “skims” that we are so unsure about in static assignment are fed back in to our demand models. How well can our sophisticated demand models do when they are being fed wrong inputs from the start? All signs seem to be pointing to simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) as the solution to our static assignment ailments, but no regional modeling agency has (to our knowledge) taken the plunge to actively explore DTA as a possible replacement for static assignment. To date, several examples of simulation-based equilibrium DTA models coupled with regional travel demand models exist. However, extraordinary run times and complexity have diminished their usefulness outside of research or for some very specific projects. This paper shares our experience to date: strategies, approach, and discoveries in applying DTA in San Francisco to evaluate its feasibility to be a part of our regional demand model as we explored various DTA packages. 19},

As the review makes clear, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veterans Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation have played major roles in the development of liberal and efficient primary and secondary mortgage markets in the United States. The development of capacity in mortgage lending and securitization in the private sector does suggest, however, that federally subsidizing mortgage market activities can be restrained with little effect on homeownership-the principal goal of this federal activity. In particular, the orderly reduction in the mortgage investment activities of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and the imposition of guarantee fees on mortgage-backed securities insured by the GSEs are first steps in restraining federal activity. More generally, a concentration of FHA and GSE activity on first-time homebuyers would reduce federal risk exposure while preserving the economic rationale for government activity.},

IUMs have been criticized over this same period on both practical and theoretical grounds. At the same time, continuing and very significant technological developments have made possible the development, implementation and use of such models in operational planning settings in various countries worldwide. A major review of the IUM state of the art and recommendations for evolution of this state were prepared by the author and colleagues 20 years ago. This paper presents an update of the 1998 report in terms of a summary of progress over the past 20 years, a critical assessment of the current IUM state of the art and practice, and needs and prospects for future development. This paper argues that the current modeling state is in “the doldrums,” similar to concerns raised by Pas in the seminal 1990 critique of activity-based travel models. It then outlines research and development needs to exploit current and emerging data, computing, and methodological developments that hold promise for the development of a much more powerful and useful “next generation” of IUMs.},

The model is based on the known physical characteristics of both networks, represented by the number of nodes, the number of links, strategies for linking individual nodes; the system characteristics of the two modes of transport?the set of high speed trains and aircraft used (numbers of seats and unit operating costs); the characteristics of the demand between individual nodes on the network in a given interval of time; and the costs of transport in each system. The chief outputs of the model are: total passenger travel costs between origins and destinations, using HSR and AT, and the minimum total costs of the systems. Both types of costs are used as criteria to establish the conditions for competition between high speed raid (HSR) and air transport (AT). The aim of the research described in this paper has been to construct a model to enable an analysis to be made of the quality of service in both high speed rail (HSR) and air transport (AT) networks and, on this basis, establish conditions for competition between HSR and AT systems.

abstract = {Background: The prevalence of childhood asthma in the USA increased by 50{\%} from 1980 to 2000, with especially high prevalence in poor urban communities. Methods: Data on the prevalence of asthma among children aged 4–5 years and on hospitalisations for asthma among children less than 15 years old were available for 42 health service catchment areas within New York City. Street tree counts were provided by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The proximity to pollution sources, sociodemographic characteristics and population density for each area were also measured. Results: Controlling for potential confounders, an increase in tree density of 1 standard deviation (SD, 343 trees/km2) was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma (RR, 0.71 per SD of tree density; 95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 0.79), but not with hospitalisations for asthma (RR, 0.89 per SD of tree density; 95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 1.06). Conclusions: Street trees were associated with a lower prevalence of early childhood asthma. This study does not permit inference that trees are causally related to asthma at the individual level. The PlaNYC sustainability initiative, which includes a commitment to plant one million trees by the year 2017, offers an opportunity for a large prospective evaluation.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new method to solve multivariate discrete–continuous problems and applies the model to measure the influence of residential density on households' vehicle fuel efficiency and usage choices. Traditional discrete–continuous modelling of vehicle holding choice and vehicle usage becomes unwieldy with large numbers of vehicles and vehicle categories. I propose a more flexible method of modelling vehicle holdings in terms of number of vehicles in each category, using a Bayesian multivariate ordinal response system. I also combine the multivariate ordered equations with Tobit equations to jointly estimate vehicle type/usage demand in a reduced form, offering a simpler alternative to the traditional discrete/continuous analysis. Using the 2001 National Household Travel Survey data, I find that increasing residential density reduces households' truck holdings and utilization in a statistically significant but economically insignificant way. The results are broadly consistent with those from a model derived from random utility maximization. The method developed above can be applied to other discrete–continuous problems.},

A discrete-continuous model of households' vehicle choice and usage, with an application to the effects of residential density





- Fang, Hao Audrey )







Fang introduces a new Bayesian Multivariate Ordered Probit {\&} Tobit model formulation to examine the effects of residential density on vehicle holdings and use, and applies the MDCEV model developed by Bhat as well. The data is information from the National Household Travel Survey in California.




Fang argues that nested logit models of auto type typically create a lower nest of combinations, making three-vehicles households prohibitively expensive to model. Fang models the number of passenger cars independently from the number of trucks, allowing households to choose any combination of the pair; VMT by each vehicle is also modeled independently. This structure provides advantages over Bhat's model in that it does not require detailed information on vehicle type and vintage, it does not exclude similar cars from a household fleet, and it does not predetermine the household VMT. The two models have almost identical results.




Fang finds that the impact of residential density on household vehicles holdings and use is statistically significant, but economically irrelevant, because "increasing residential density within feasible ranges will have a very small impact...".




I am interested in why she elected to cast income as a categorical variable. I don't know how the NHTS reports income, but the categories she applies seem clunky, and could significantly affect her model outcomes.

We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages.

Second, the battles were fought in the open field, not in urban areas.

abstract = {We compared several modeling strategies for vaccine adverse event count data in which the data are characterized by excess zeroes and heteroskedasticity. Count data are routinely modeled using Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB) regression but zero-inflated and hurdle models may be advantageous in this setting. Here we compared the fit of the Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Poisson Hurdle (PH), and Negative Binomial Hurdle (NBH) models. In general, for public health studies, we may conceptualize zero-inflated models as allowing zeroes to arise from at-risk and not-at-risk populations. In contrast, hurdle models may be conceptualized as having zeroes only from an at-risk population. Our results illustrate, for our data, that the ZINB and NBH models are preferred but these models are indistinguishable with respect to fit. Choosing between the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling framework, assuming Poisson and NB models are inadequate because of excess zeroes, should generally be based on the study design and purpose. If the study's purpose is inference then modeling framework should be considered. For example, if the study design leads to count endpoints with both structural and sample zeroes then generally the zero-inflated modeling framework is more appropriate, while in contrast, if the endpoint of interest, by design, only exhibits sample zeroes (e.g., at-risk participants) then the hurdle model framework is generally preferred. Conversely, if the study's primary purpose it is to develop a prediction model then both the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling frameworks should be adequate.},

abstract = {Limited research is available to help transportation agencies make decisions about installing right-turn deceleration lanes at uncontrolled approaches of unsignalized intersections and driveways. Criteria for right-turn lanes developed by some agencies do not adequately consider the effects of through and right-turn movement volumes and speeds. To evaluate the need for right-turn lanes, the percentage of through vehicles behind right-turning vehicles in the outside (right) lane that perform evasive maneuvers because of the presence of right-turning vehicles has been used as a surrogate. This measure is difficult to use under different combinations of volumes, speeds, and other operating conditions; it also cannot be estimated from traffic simulation models if these models are used to evaluate the need for right-turn deceleration lanes. Safety is the most important factor when deciding to provide a deceleration right lane. The speed differential between through vehicles affected by right-turning vehicles and those not affected by these turns is used to determine the need for right-turn deceleration lanes at unsignalized intersections. The speed differential measure has been shown to be a surrogate to safety and to be related to crash involvement. To determine the total speed differential caused by right-turning vehicles in the outside lane, two variables are needed: the number of through vehicles in the outside lane affected by right-turning vehicles and the average drop in speed of affected vehicles. Total speed differential can be used to evaluate the need for a right-turn deceleration lane.},

abstract = {The propensity to travel by rail, and not, for example by car, can be considered to be a factor of the rail service offered, the access to it and the characteristics of the population served. Efforts to increase rail use usually focus on the rail service itself while the accessibility of the rail network receives less attention. In this context, the paper has two broad aims. First, to evaluate how important the ‘access-to-the-station' part of a rail journey is to passengers in their overall satisfaction with the rail journey and second, to investigate the balance between characteristics of the service, the access to it and the population served in determining rail use in different parts of the rail network. The analysis is carried out for the Netherlands. To achieve the first aim, we use the Dutch Railways customer satisfaction survey and apply principal component analysis and derived importance techniques to assess the relative importance of accessibility in determining the overall satisfaction with the rail journey. For the second aim, we use regression analysis to explain, at the Dutch postcode level, the propensity to use rail. We find that satisfaction with the level and quality of the access to the station is an important dimension of the rail journey which influences the overall satisfaction from that journey and that the quality and level of accessibility is an important element in explaining rail use. The conclusion reached is that in many parts of the rail network improving and expanding access services to the railway station can substitute for improving and expanding the services provided on the rail network and that it is probably more cost efficient when the aim is to increase rail use. These parts of the network are mainly in the periphery where the current level of rail service is relatively low.},

First, we account for complex design factors in Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data such as clustering, stratification, and sample weight using Complex Samples General Linear Model (CSGLM). Then, three variables are used in the model as indicators of social inequality, low socioeconomic status (SES): unemployment, education status, and social association status. A geographically weighted regression analysis is applied to examine the spatial variations in the associations of mentally unhealthy days (MUDs) with the indicators of SES in the United States. The results demonstrate that unemployment and education level show global positive and negative influences respectively on MUDs. Social association status ranged from positive to negative across the United States, implying some geographic clustering. These findings suggest t...},

abstract = {Proximity to parks and physical activity sites has been linked to an increase in active behaviors, and positive impacts on health outcomes such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since populations with a low socio-economic status as well as racial and ethnic minorities tend to experience worse health outcomes in the USA, access to parks and physical activity sites may be an environmental justice issue. Geographic Information systems were used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of park accessibility in New York City, which included kernel density estimation, ordinary least squares (global) regression, geographically weighted (local) regression, and longitudinal case studies, consisting of field work and archival research. Accessibility was measured by both density of park acreage and density of physical activity sites. Independent variables included percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, percent below poverty, percent of adults without high school diploma, percent with limited English-speaking ability, and population density. The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (Ra2 = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationarity in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the complexity of the issues around racial and ethnic disparities in park access. They revealed trends that may not have been otherwise detectable, such as the spatially inconsistent relationship between physical activity site density and socio-demographics. In order to establish a more stable global model, a number of additional factors, variables, and methods might be used to quantify park accessibility, such as network analysis of proximity, perception of accessibility and usability, and additional park quality characteristics. Accurate measurement of park accessibility can therefore be important in showing the links between opportunities for active behavior and beneficial health outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the contribution that historical property records can make to our understanding of long run urban change. We use a case study of two streets from the suburb of Carlton in Melbourne, Australia between 1870 and 1970. The property records form a panel database that can be interrogated using standard modelling techniques. These data are used to analyse change in the built environment over time, and identify the factors that may be influencing such change. With the assembled data we track built form, land value, ownership and land use over 100 years. We find that stability characterises the built environment over lengthy periods, but when change occurs it does so in bursts, rather than incrementally. Furthermore, these bursts of change are unevenly spread across our two case study streets, despite their proximity. The streetscape's primary built material is the key factor shaping geographical patterns of land use change in the case study area.},

abstract = {Sustainable development efforts in urban areas often focus on understanding and managing factors that influence all aspects of health and wellbeing. Research has shown that public parks and green space provide a variety of physical, psychological, and social benefits to urban residents, but few studies have examined the influence of parks on comprehensive measures of subjective wellbeing at the city level. Using 2014 data from 44 U.S. cities, we evaluated the relationship between urban park quantity, quality, and accessibility and aggregate self-reported scores on the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index (WBI), which considers five different domains of wellbeing (e.g., physical, community, social, financial, and purpose). In addition to park-related variables, our best-fitting OLS regression models selected using an information theory approach controlled for a variety of other typical geographic and socio-demographic correlates of wellbeing. Park quantity (measured as the percentage of city area covered by public parks) was among the strongest predictors of overall wellbeing, and the strength of this relationship appeared to be driven by parks' contributions to physical and community wellbeing. Park quality (measured as per capita spending on parks) and accessibility (measured as the overall percentage of a city's population within ½ mile of parks) were also positively associated with wellbeing, though these relationships were not significant. Results suggest that expansive park networks are linked to multiple aspects of health and wellbeing in cities and positively impact urban quality of life.},

This was a period of rapid economic and social change in Ireland, with the proportion of households with one or more cars growing from 74.6{\%} to 80.8{\%}. Understanding the determinants of household car ownership, a key determinant of household travel behaviour more generally, is particularly important in the context of current policy developments which seek to encourage more sustainable means of travel. In this paper, we use longitudinal data to estimate dynamic models of household car own- ership, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. We find income and previous car ownership to be the strongest determinants of differences in household car ownership, with the effect of permanent income having a stronger and more significant effect on the probability of household car ownership than current income. In addition, income elasticities differ by previous car ownership status, with income elasticities higher for those households with no car in the initial period. Other important influences include household composition (in particular, the presence of young children) and lifecycle effects, which create challenges for policymakers in seeking to change travel behaviour.},

In this paper, we examine through econometric means the air carriers' reaction to these HSR entrances into the transport market with data at the route level. We test whether the HSR lines have affected the airlines' travel frequencies and market shares. Our results show that on average, HSR has reduced the number of air transport operations by 17 per cent. At the same time, travel demand has increased substantially, though the share of air transport in the total market has declined, as has the share of the dominant Spanish air carrier, Iberia.},

As such, an event analysis approach using  survival analysis' is adopted as the statistical analytical tool. It tests whether proximity to rail transit is related to the onset of gentrification in census tracts in Canada's largest cities. It is found that proximity to rail transit, and to other gentrifying census tracts, have a statistically significant effect on gentrification in two of the three cities analysed.

abstract = {The recent financial crisis has revealed the financial vulnerability faced by a significant number of households in the UK. Households experiencing financial problems may potentially fall into arrears in meeting financial obligations such as rent, mortgage payments or household bills. Indeed, such arrears have been regarded as one of the most direct measures of financial stress at the household level. In this paper, we explore the relationship between household repayment behaviour and neighbourhood ties in order to identify possible channels of support for households experiencing financial stress. We analyse data on 17,723 households drawn from wave 1 of the UK longitudinal study, Understanding Society, merged with information on neighbourhood ties defined at the postcode area level elicited from a sample of 48,906 individuals. Our findings, which relate to the post financial crisis era, suggest that households in regions characterised by strong neighbourhood ties are less likely to report being in arrears and that this relationship is particularly apparent in the case of housing costs. This inverse relationship is strongest in regions characterised by a high density of individuals who feel able to turn to someone in the neighbourhood for support or advice. Thus, neighbourhood and community groups, which enhance social interaction and neighbourhood ties, may be effective channels of support for financially vulnerable households.},

abstract = {High-speed rail has developed both nationally and internationally in Europe as a successful alternative to both air and road over distances of 400–600km. Inter-city traffic, especially between the major metropolitan areas in North-west Europe has benefitted greatly from the investment in this network. This paper explores two issues: the impact on the intermediate areas between these major metropolitan areas and the creation of potential cross-border inter-regional services. The evidence shows how both levels of service and potential economic impacts have been much less pronounced in these intermediate areas. Such areas have been affected both by a failure to see greatly improved direct access to major cities other than within their own countries and a lack of new cross-border inter-regional services. The paper argues that the creation of the high-speed rail TEN-T has not met the primary objectives of reducing regional disparities in accessibility or reducing the effect of national borders on regional integration. To achieve this requires not just infrastructure provision but an appropriate regulatory framework for service provision and accompanying measures at the local level.},

The information rates of the three slide samples were equivalent. Measurements were taken of the effects of the slide presentations on alpha amplitude, heart rate, and emotional states. Results revealed several significant differences as a function of environment, which together indicate that the two categories of nature views had more positive influences on psychophysiological states than the urban scenes. Alpha was significantly higher during the vegetation as opposed to urban slides; similarly, alpha was higher on the average when subjects viewed water rather than urban content. There was also a consistent pattern for nature, especially water, to have more positive influences on emotional states. A salient finding was that water, and to a lesser extent vegetation views, held attention and interest more effectively than the urban scenes. Implicati...},

abstract = {We examine the accessibility benefits associated with some land-use policy strategies for the Netherlands that anticipate on expected climate change. A disaggregate logsum accessibility measure using the Dutch national land-use/transport interaction model TIGRIS XL is used to compute changes in consumer surplus. The measure provides an elegant and convenient solution to measure the full accessibility benefits from land-use and/or transport policies, when discrete choice travel-demand models are available that already produce logsums. It accounts for both changes in generalised transport costs and changes in destination utility, and is thus capable of providing the accessibility benefits from changes in the distribution of activities, due to transport or land-use policies. The case study shows that logsum accessibility benefits from land-use policy strategies can be quite large compared to investment programmes for road and public transport infrastructure, largely due to changes in trip production and destination utility, which are not measured in the standard rule-of-half benefit measure.},

abstract = {Activity based travel demand models are becoming essential tools used in transportation planning and regional de-velopment scenario evaluation. They describe travel itineraries of individual travelers, namely what activities they are participating in, when they perform these activities, and how they choose to travel to the activity locales. However, data collection for activity based models is performed through travel surveys that are infrequent, expensive, and reflect the changes in transportation with significant delays. Thanks to the ubiquitous cell phone data, we see an opportunity to substantially complement these surveys with data extracted from network carrier mobile phone usage logs, such as call detail records (CDRs). In this paper, we develop Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMMs) to infer travelers' activity patterns from CDRs. We apply the model to the data collected by a major network carrier serving millions of users in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our approach delivers an end-to-end actionable solution to the practitioners in the form of a modular and interpretable activity-based travel demand model. It is experimentally validated with three independent data sources: aggregated statistics from travel surveys, a set of collected ground truth activities, and the results of a traffic micro-simulation informed with the travel plans synthesized from the developed generative model.},

More specifically, it demon- strates the use of an activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure as an important variable in residential zone choice, thus serving as the link between short-term activity and travel decisions and long-term resi- dential choice decisions. We develop a partial activity-based model accounting for the interrelationship of the main activity type, travel destination and mode choice. The log-sum at the top of the hierar- chy of this model is the ABA measure capturing the overall utility of all travel alternatives. The results show that this measure is a highly significant variable in the residential-choice model, clearly indicating the great influence of activity accessibility, short-term opportunities, and travel decisions on residential area choice. All other log-sums were also significant, showing the interrelationships of all choices. Specifi- cally, the destination-choice log-sum in the main activity-choice model demonstrates that as accessibility increases, people are more likely to participate in out-of-home activities.},

abstract = {Transportation improvements are often considered to be precursors of economic growth. This paper examines industry-specific ‘attractiveness' due to changes in the transportation network for 23 counties in the Appalachian Region. The network improvements result from new highway construction and the proposed America 2050 High-Speed Rail (HSR) plan for the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion. The impacted counties that are proximate to five HSR stations (Birmingham, Atlanta, Greenville, Charlotte, and Greensboro) are studied for potential accessibility changes between the years 2002 to 2035. The impacts are examined with respect to six key industry sectors found around the proposed HSR stations: manufacturing; retail; construction; mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction; health-care services; and all other remaining industries combined. The analysis shows that, for transportation improvements with highways only (and no HSR), a decrease in accessibility for all the impacted counties occurs for the six industry sectors examined in the future year of 2035. The HSR speed of 150miles per hour is found to be adequate enough to cause positive changes in potential accessibility of the directly impacted counties containing the Birmingham and Greenville HSR stations. With combined transportation network improvements from both highway construction and the new 150mph HSR line, counties around the Atlanta and Greensboro HSR stations would see accessibility increases in 2035 compared to 2002 with respect to five industry sectors: manufacturing; retail; construction; health-care services; and all other remaining industries combined. However, accessibility changes with respect to mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction would be positive specifically only for the indirectly impacted counties around the Atlanta HSR station and the county containing the Greenville HSR station. This clearly shows differences in the spatial distribution of attractiveness for different industry sectors across the impacted counties along the HSR corridor. Thus, this exploratory analysis could serve as an aid to proactive public policy decision-making for large-scale transportation network improvements, such as the HSR, in understanding and improving economic activities for different industry mixes across other regions of the United States.},

abstract = {Suburban sprawl has been widely criticized for its contribution to auto dependence. Numerous studies have found that residents in suburban neighborhoods drive more and walk less than their counterparts in traditional environments. However, most studies confirm only an association between the built environment and travel behavior, and have yet to establish the predominant underlying causal link: whether neighborhood design independently influences travel behavior or whether preferences for travel options affect residential choice. That is, residential self-selection may be at work. A few studies have recently addressed the influence of self-selection. However, our understanding of the causality issue is still immature. To address this issue, this study took into account individuals' self-selection by employing a quasi-longitudinal design and by controlling for residential preferences and travel attitudes. In particular, using data collected from 547 movers currently living in four traditional neighborhoods and four suburban neighborhoods in Northern California, we developed a structural equations model to investigate the relationships among changes in the built environment, changes in auto ownership, and changes in travel behavior. The results provide some encouragement that land-use policies designed to put residents closer to destinations and provide them with alternative transportation options will actually lead to less driving and more walking.},

Na ̈ıve estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and spatially endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market. We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression. This finding has unpredictable consequences for land value capture forecasts and transportation policy decisions.},

While active travel has been shown to be associated with features of the built environment such as density and land-use mix, it is also associated with walking and cycling accessibility-which we designate as active accessibility. However, the measurement of active accessibility is not straightforward and it can represent significantly different features of the built environment. This paper presents an extensive review of published research that measures active accessibility. We classified the literature into four categories based on the methodology used: distance-based, gravity-based or potential, topological or infrastructure-based, and walkability and walk score-type measures. A fifth category was created to classify outliers consisting of distinct methodological approaches or hybrids of the four main categories. We argue that almost all of these methods have conceptual and computational limitations, and that there are inconsistencies in the use of concepts and terms. Furthermore, no sensitivity analysis was carried out on the selected parameters. We conclude by presenting some guidelines that might improve the value and clarity of active accessibility research, theory, and practice.]},

abstract = {This paper focuses on two lines of investigation with regard to access to railway stations in the Netherlands. Firstly, the profile of the access and egress modes on journeys to and from railway stations is analyzed. We also examine how the availability of car affects the mode choice on journeys to the station. Secondly, the effect of passengers' perception of the station and of the journey to the station on the overall perception of traveling by rail is estimated. The results show that most of the passengers choose walking, bicycle and public transport to get to or from the railway station and that the availability of a car does not have a strong effect on the choice of access mode to the station. The quality of the station and the access/egress facilities was found to have an important effect on the general perception of traveling by rail.},

abstract = {The Tea Party exploded on the US political scene with President Barack Obama's election and scholarly research focuses on its role in national issues. However, Tea Party and property rights advocates, among others, also fiercely oppose sustainability city planning issues, recently having legislation introduced in 26 US states to stop such practices. They perceive planning as directly connected to the United Nation's 1992 document, Agenda 21: the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment. The counter-narrative suggests the UN seeks to restrict individual property rights and American sovereignty. Meanwhile, Agenda 21-related planning is favourably considered and practiced worldwide. Through a mixed-methods approach using quantitative and case-based research, we track the opposition's emergence through the introduction and sometimes adoption of state legislation. We draw conclusions and implications for research and practice using a theoretical framework routed in scholarship from planning, geography, political science, and communications/new media.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) promise many benefits for future mobility. One of them is a reduction of the required total vehicle fleet size, especially if AVs are used predominantly as shared vehicles. This paper presents an investigation of this reduction potential using a simulation approach. Fleets of shared AVs, which serve predefined demands, are simulated with the simulation framework presented in the paper. Different demand scenarios are used, which represent different shares of a spatially and temporally detailed representation of the car travel demand of the greater Zurich region, Switzerland. These demand scenarios are combined with different supply scenarios assuming different AV fleet sizes. It is found that for a given fleet performance target (here 95{\{}{\%}{\}} of all transport requests are served within 5 minutes) the relationship between served demand and required fleet size is non-linear and the ratio decreases as the demand increases. So there is, as could be expected, a scale effect, which has the important implication that for different levels of demand the fleet is used more or less efficiently. This paper also finds that, if waiting times of up to 10 minutes are accepted, a reduction of up to 90{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total vehicle fleet can be possible even without active fleet management like vehicle redistribution. Such effects require however, that a large enough share of the car demand can be served by AVs.},

abstract = {Auto ownership modeling plays an important role in travel demand analysis because it is a key determinant of the travel behavior of individuals and households. Discrete-choice auto ownership models use either an ordered-response choice mechanism or an unordered-response choice mechanism. The ordered-response mechanism is based on the hypothesis that an uni-dimensional continuous latent auto ownership propensity index determines the level of car ownership. The unordered-response mechanism is based on the Random Utility Maximization principle. This paper presents the underlying theoretical structures, and identifies the advantages and disadvantages, of the two alternative response mechanisms. The paper also compares the ordered-response mechanism (represented by the ordered-response logit model) and the unordered-response mechanism (represented by the multinomial logit model) empirically using several data sets. This comparative analysis offers strong evidence that the appropriate choice mechanism is the unordered-response structure. As a general guideline, auto ownership modeling must be pursued using the unordered-response class of models (such as the multinomial logit or probit model) and not using the ordered-response class of models (such as the ordered-response logit or probit).},

Over the last couple of decades there has been an increasing attention to the lack of demand forecast accuracy, but since data availability for comprehensive ex- post appraisals is problematic, such studies are still relatively rare. The present paper presents a review of the largest ex-post studies of demand forecast accuracy for transport infrastructure projects. The focus is twofold; to provide an overview of observed levels of demand forecast inaccuracy and to explore the primary explanations offered for the observed inaccuracy. Inaccuracy in the form of both bias and imprecision remains problematic for road, rail and toll projects alike, but the explanatory causes are difficult to pinpoint. Systematic ex-post evaluations and improved archiving protocols are suggested as necessary steps to improve the learning aspect of ex-post evaluations, as all studies in the review suffer from severe lack of data availability.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding the economic impacts of transportation projects is essential for decision makers, officials, and stakeholders as they determine the best course of action for their jurisdiction. Economic impacts can guide decisions of future projects and help explain past economic fluctuations. This study uses an evaluative (ex-post) analysis process to assess the generative economic impacts of transportation projects after completion that can be used to identify the economic impacts of transportation projects while quantifying their relationship. Both pre- and postconstruction data were collected and used to compare the trends of sales tax revenue and employment numbers adjacent to transportation projects in Utah over a 10-year period. Plots of the trends before, during, and after construction for each project in the analysis were generated. A formal process was created for completing the analysis for future study. Results indicate that there is a positive relationship between transportation improvement projects and sales tax revenues. This relationship amounts to approximately a 4.0 percent increase in trends compared to the state overall. Employment demonstrated a 4.5 percent increase compared to the state overall. Although the results are not considered statistically significant, they are considered practically significant and add to the literature on this topic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The methods of discrete choice analysis and their applications in the modelling of transportation systems constitute a comparatively new field that has largely evolved over the past 15 years. Since its inception, however, the field has developed rapidly, and this is the first text and reference work to cover the material systematically, bringing together the scattered and often inaccessible results for graduate students and professionals.Discrete Choice Analysis presents these results in such a way that they are fully accessible to the range of students and professionals who are involved in modelling demand and consumer behavior in general or specifically in transportation - whether from the point of view of the design of transit systems, urban and transport economics, public policy, operations research, or systems management and planning.The introductory chapter presents the background of discrete choice analysis and context of transportation demand forecasting. Subsequent chapters cover, among other topics, the theories of individual choice behavior, binary and multinomial choice models, aggregate forecasting techniques, estimation methods, tests used in the process of model development, sampling theory, the nested-logit model, and systems of models.Moshe Ben-Akiva and Steven R. Lerman are both faculty members of the Civil Engineering Department at MIT and affiliated with its Center for Transportation Studies.

Park use patterns however are not equal in terms of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. In order to design policies to improve park design and to provide healthy park experiences among children of communities of color, insight on park use patterns is needed. This research examines the association between park characteristics and park use among children 5–10 years old from Asian, Latino and African American backgrounds. Using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC), systematic observations were conducted in 20 New York City parks in 2017, located in low-income areas with high presence of Latino or Asian residents. 16,577 children from 5 to 10 years old were observed. Playgrounds and swings were common use areas across ethnicities, both in terms of number of children and their physical activity. Other activity settings such as basketball courts, handball and baseball fields showed distinct patterns of use among the different ethnicities. Significant associations between park use, physical activity levels and the characteristics of the park area, with distinct patterns by race/ethnicity. Findings underline the importance of considering different design and features when trying to appeal to different populations.},

While their main purpose is to collect revenue, they also produce large quantities of very detailed data on onboard transactions. These data can be very useful to transit planners, from the day-to-day operation of the transit system to the strategic long-term planning of the network. This review covers several aspects of smart card data use in the public transit context. First, the technologies are presented: the hardware and information systems required to operate these tools; and privacy concerns and legal issues related to the dissemination of smart card data, data storage, and encryption are addressed. Then, the various uses of the data at three levels of management are described: strategic (long-term planning), tactical (service adjustments and network development), and oper-ational (ridership statistics and performance indicators). Also reported are smart card com-mercialization experiments conducted all over the world. Finally, the most promising research avenues for smart card data in this field are presented; for example, comparison of planned and implemented schedules, systematic schedule adjustments, and the survival models applied to ridership.},

This paper develops a theory of conspicuous conservation, a phenomenon attributable to increasing concern about environmental damage and climate change in which individuals seek status through displays of austerity rather than ostentation. We test for the presence of a conspicuous conservation eﬀect in vehicle purchase decisions and estimate the willingness to pay for the “ green” signal generated by the Toyota Prius, which until 2010 was the only hybrid vehicle on the road that provided standard amenities and a unique and recognizable model design. Using observed variation in model ownership rates across communities in Colorado and Washington, we identify a statistically and economically signiﬁcant conspicuous conservation eﬀect and estimate a mean willingness to pay for the green signal in the range of {\$}430 to {\$}1,300 in Washington and {\$}1,400 to {\$}4,200 in Colorado. We relate these ﬁndings to a growing literature on green markets and consider the implications of signaling motives for the private provision of public goods and for achieving eﬃcient investment in conservation projects.},

abstract = {This paper analyses changes in accessibility that might result from a new High-Speed Rail (HSR) line in the UK. A proposal for such a line put forward by Network Rail in 2009 is used as the basis for the analysis. Using travel time to London as the main benchmark to measure accessibility of a station on the current (conventional) and future (high-speed) rail networks the paper examines the likely winners and losers from the construction of the new line. The results show that the accessibility benefits from the proposed line are relatively limited in terms of geographic spread and that many cities close to it would not see any travel time reductions on journeys to London, thus will not see any accessibility benefits in this respect. For such places, this will translate to a relative reduction in the accessibility to London, when compared to other locations, and thus to potentially adverse socioeconomic implications. The paper concludes by arguing that any examination of a HSR line must consider a wider geographic area than just the cities, and especially the stations, on the line and it therefore must give due consideration to integration between transport networks, and especially between the high-speed and conventional rail networks. Based on the current analysis, the paper concludes that the case for a HSR line in the UK from a regional accessibility perspective is questionable.},

abstract = {Over the last 50 years there has been a tenfold increase in the number of cars in Great Britain, rising from 2.6 million vehicles in 1951 to 27 million vehicles in 2001. Over the same period there has been a steady reduction in the proportion of households without access to a car and a steady increase in the proportion of households with two or more cars. If such trends continue, it is likely that there will be increased energy consumption, increased problems with traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution, and reductions to the financial viability of public transport. Given the importance of car ownership to transport and land-use planning and its relationship with energy consumption, the environment and health, it is the objective of this research to develop econometric models of household car ownership and apply the models to generate forecasts across Britain to the year 2031. To achieve this objective, the research develops discrete choice models of the household's decision to own zero, one, two or three or more vehicles as a function of market saturation, licence holding, household income and structure, household employment, company car provision, and purchase and use costs. The models are validated to data from the 2001 Census and are used to develop a range of forecasts taking into account changes to the socio-demographic characteristics of Britain.},

We consider an extended version of the linear-in-means model where interactions are structured through a social network. We assume that correlated unobservables are either absent, or treated as network fixed effects. We provide easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions for identification. We show that endogenous and exogenous effects are generally identified under network interaction, although identification may fail for some particular structures. We use data from the Add Health survey to provide an empirical application of our results on the consumption of recreational services (e.g., participation in artistic, sports and social activities) by secondary school students. Monte Carlo simulations calibrated on this application provide an analysis of the effects of some crucial characteristics of a network (i.e., density, intransitivity) on the estimates of peer effects.

abstract = {Project promoters, forecasters, and managers sometimes object to two things in measuring inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting: (1) using the forecast made at the time of making the decision to build as the basis for measuring inaccuracy and (2) using traffic during the first year of operations as the basis for measurement. This paper presents the case against both objections. First, if one is interested in learning whether decisions about building transport infrastructure are based on reliable information, then it is exactly the traffic forecasted at the time of making the decision to build that is of interest. Second, although ideally studies should take into account so-called demand “ramp up” over a period of years, the empirical evidence and practical considerations do not support this ideal requirement, at least not for large-N studies. Finally, the paper argues that large samples of inaccuracy in travel demand forecasts are likely to be conservatively biased, i.e., accuracy in travel demand forecasts estimated from such samples would likely be higher than accuracy in travel demand forecasts in the project population. This bias must be taken into account when interpreting the results from statistical analyses of inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting.},

abstract = {The logsum is a measure of consumer surplus in the context of logit choice models. In spite of the very frequent use of logit models in transport, project assessment is only rarely done using logsums. Instead in project evaluation or appraisal, changes in transport costs and time (borrowing values of time from some source) are commonly used to get the traveller benefits. The paper contains a review of the theoretical and applied literature on the use of logsums as a measure of consumer surplus change in project appraisal and evaluation. It then goes on to describe a case study with the Dutch National Model System for transport in which the logsum method and the commonly used value of time method are compared for a specific project (high speed trains that would connect the four main cities in the Randstad: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht).},

Certain empirical studies consider car ownership as the dependent variable explained by the built environment, whereas other studies deem it to be one of the independent variables explaining car travel behaviour. This paper takes note of the dual influence car ownership has in explaining car travel behaviour by assuming that car ownership mediates the relationship between the built environment and car use. The relationship is estimated using a structural equation model since it accounts for mediating variables. This approach confirms the intermediary nature of car ownership.},

abstract = {Using a system of structural equations, this paper empirically examines the relationship of residential neighborhood type to travel behavior, incorporating attitudinal, lifestyle, and demographic variables. Data on these variables were collected from residents of five neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1993 (final N ¼ 515), including ‘‘traditional'' and ‘‘suburban'' as well as mixtures of those two extremes. A conceptual model of the interrelationships among the key variables of interest was operationalized with a nineequation structural model system. The nine endogenous variables included two measures of residential location type, three measures of travel demand, three attitudinal measures, and one measure of job location. In terms of both direct and total e¤ects, attitudinal and lifestyle variables had the greatest impact on travel demand among all the explanatory variables. By contrast, residential location type had little impact on travel behavior. This is perhaps the strongest evidence to date supporting the speculation that the association commonly observed between land use configuration and travel patterns is not one of direct causality, but due primarily to correlations of each of those variables with others. In particular, the results suggest that when attitudinal, lifestyle, and sociodemographic variables are accounted for, neighborhood type has little influence on travel behavior.},

abstract = {Public health initiatives have made important but relatively modest gains through individual-level and nonecological health-promotion efforts aimed at increasing physical activity. The previously overlooked built environment is now being considered as facilitating or hindering one's ability to be active. The multiuse greenway is an example of a facility that can support physical activity, but its level of use may be influenced by the accessibility characteristics of the areas surrounding the greenway. In this study, an unobtrusive methodology using GPS and GIS technology was employed to test whether two variables used to measure accessibility, proximity (population density) and opportunities (land-use mixture), predicted the use of greenway segments. The results presented here allow us to confirm that smaller walking and bicycling scales of analysis are better predictors of physical-activity behavior. The results also suggest that solely bringing environmental support for physical activity closer to conce...},

The authors adopt the notion that the “environment” constitutes the space outside the person and therefore broaden the common conceptualization of the “environment” to encompass a full spectrum from small-scale design elements to large-scale community infrastructure. An energy balance approach is also adopted. The energy balance perspective recognizes the equilibrium of food consumption and energy expenditure, rather than focusing solely on one or the other side of the equation. The authors consider how environmental characteristics present either barriers (that hinder), or supports (that promote) healthy habits. Thus, they describe a range of obesity-related environmental themes that provide opportunities for innovative collaborative research between environmental psychologists and colleagues in fields ranging from apparel design to landscape architecture.

We discuss reasons for the existence of spatial effects in vehicle ownership, and note potential implications for policymakers. Our results point to the importance of spatial relationships in transportation research and highlight the hazards of ignoring their role in affecting transportation outcomes. For example, if vehicle type choice is affected by neighborhood spillovers, agencies that regulate traffic flow and road safety could tailor their choice projections and policy tools to account for such interdependence.},

Autocorrelation?




Role of inter-household utility perception.




Use 2000 BATS, merged with 2000 Census to create aggregate explanatory variables. Needed at least 10 surveys in a tract to retain, so eliminated more than half of the census tracts.




Disaggregate from BATS, looking only at 2000 model year cars. (Cannot account for used car purchases!)




Why use Bernoulli distribution?




It seems that the Equifax data would "allow a more comprehensive modeling approach to future empirical pursuit of this topic."},

abstract = {Traditional travel diary surveys collect 1 or 2 days of travel data from participant households. Although useful in determining the overall average travel behavior of a regional population, cross-sectional travel diary surveys provide little insight into intrahousehold and intraperson trip variability. Longitudinal surveys are generally preferred for examining travel variability. The objective of the research is to examine the intrahousehold travel variability in the Commute Atlanta, Georgia, study, a Global Positioning System–based instrumented-vehicle monitoring study that collected vehicle trips from approximately 500 vehicles in 260 representative households. The research effort uses 2004 travel data collected for the Commute Atlanta study, in which the average variability or deviation in the number of trips by a household was 3 trips/day. Demographic variables (e.g., household size, household income, vehicle ownership, number of children, number of workers, and number of students) significantly affect the day-to-day variability in the total number of household trips per day. The variability due to seasonal effects is controlled by separately analyzing travel data during specific months in spring, summer, and fall. Results indicate that demographic variables have a significant effect on the day-to-day variability of the household number of trips when the variability associated with seasonal effects is excluded. Vehicles identified by participants as being used always or occasionally for business or commercial purposes have travel patterns different from those of other vehicles, and their presence in the sample will significantly bias analytical results in the analysis of longitudinal data. Commercial use vehicles are excluded from travel variability analysis, and the argument is made that households with such vehicles must be treated as an independent sample in future travel diary data collection and longitudinal studies.},

abstract = {It is well reported that induced travel is an important component of travel demand. With improved transportation conditions, short run effects (e.g., route switches, mode switches, changes of destination, and new trip generation) and long term effects (e.g., change in household auto ownership, and spatial reallocation of activities) will be observed. This paper aims to develop an integrated intercity travel demand modelling system suitable for substantial changes in service level. The model utilizes combined estimation across multiple data sources such as SP, RP and aggregate data. This integrated intercity travel demand modelling system is characterized by an explicit intercity travel behavioural framework and its ability to capture induced travel. Intercity travel decisions are represented by a nested model structure, and an accessibility measure is introduced to capture short term induced travel. The paper also sketches a way to estimate induced travel resulting from long term changes (spatial reallocation of activities). As a case study, an integrated model including trip generation, destination choice, mode choice, and route choice is presented for an intercity high speed rail project planned in Japan, and short term induced travel elasticities with respect to travel cost, travel time, and etc. are also presented.},

abstract = {A now substantial body of literature finds that land use and urban form have a statistically significant, albeit relatively modest, effect on travel behavior. Some scholars have suggested that various built-environment characteristics influence travel more in concert than when considered in isolation. Yet few previous studies have combined built-environment measures to create holistic descriptions of the over-all character of neighborhoods, and fewer still have related these neigh-borhoods to residents' travel decisions. To address this gap in the lit-erature, we develop a typology of seven distinct neighborhood types by applying factor analysis and then cluster analysis to a set of 20 variables describing built-environment characteristics for most census tracts in the United States. We then include these neighborhood types in a set of multivariate regression models to estimate the effect of neighborhood type on the travel behavior of neighborhood residents, controlling for an array of personal and household characteristics. We find relatively little variation in the number of daily trips among neighborhood types, but there is substantial neighborhood variation in both person miles of travel and mode choice. Travel by residents of one particular neighbor-hood type is notably distinguished from all others by a very low num-ber of miles traveled, little solo driving, and high transit use. However, this neighborhood type is found almost exclusively in just a few very large metropolitan areas, and its replicability is uncertain.},

abstract = {Parks provide ideal open spaces for leisure-time physical activity and important venues to promote physical activity. The spatial configuration of parks, the number of parks and their spatial distribution across neighborhood areas or local regions, represents the basic park access potential for their residential populations. A new measure of spatial access to parks, population-weighted distance (PWD) to parks, combines the advantages of current park access approaches and incorporates the information processing theory and probability access surface model to more accurately quantify residential population's potential spatial access to parks. The PWD was constructed at the basic level of US census geography - blocks - using US park and population data. This new measure of population park accessibility was aggregated to census tract, county, state and national levels. On average, US residential populations are expected to travel 6.7 miles to access their local neighborhood parks. There are significant differences in the PWD to local parks among states. The District of Columbia and Connecticut have the best access to local neighborhood parks with PWD of 0.6 miles and 1.8 miles, respectively. Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming have the largest PWDs of 62.0, 37.4, and 32.8 miles, respectively. Rural states in the western and Midwestern US have lower neighborhood park access, while urban states have relatively higher park access. The PWD to parks provides a consistent platform for evaluating spatial equity of park access and linking with population health outcomes. It could be an informative evaluation tool for health professionals and policy makers. This new method could be applied to quantify geographic accessibility of other types of services or destinations, such as food, alcohol, and tobacco outlets.},

@article{trc_ridership_paper,
abstract = {In the past few years, numerous mobile applications have made it possible for public tran- sit passengers to find routes and/or learn about the expected arrival time of their transit vehicles. Though these services are widely used, their impact on overall transit ridership remains unclear. The objective of this research is to assess the effect of real-time informa- tion provided via web-enabled and mobile devices on public transit ridership. An empirical evaluation is conducted for New York City, which is the setting of a natural experiment in which a real-time bus tracking system was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis beginning in 2011. Panel regression techniques are used to evaluate bus ridership over a three year period, while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socio- economic conditions, weather, and other factors. A fixed effects model of average weekday unlinked bus trips per month reveals an increase of approximately 118 trips per route per weekday (median increase of 1.7{\%} of weekday route-level ridership) attributable to provid- ing real-time information. Further refinement of the fixed effects model suggests that this ridership increase may only be occurring on larger routes; specifically, the largest quartile of routes defined by revenue miles of service realized approximately 340 additional trips per route per weekday (median increase of 2.3{\%} per route). Although the increase in week- day route-level ridership may appear modest, on aggregate these increases exert a substan- tial positive effect on farebox revenue. The implications of this research are critical to decision-makers at the country's transit operators who face pressure to increase ridership under limited budgets, particularly as they seek to prioritize investments in infrastructure, service offerings, and new technologies.

abstract = {Information produced by travel demand models plays a large role decision making in many metropolitan areas, and San Francisco is no exception. Being a transit first city, one of the most common uses for San Francisco's travel model SF-CHAMP is to analyze transit demand under various circumstances. SF-CHAMP v 4.1 (Harold) is able to capture the effects of several aspects of transit provision including headways, stop placement, and travel time. However, unlike how auto level of service in a user equilibrium traffic assignment is responsive to roadway capacity, SF-CHAMP Harold is unable to capture any benefit related to capacity expansion, crowding's effect on travel time nor or any of the real-life true capacity limitations. The failure to represent these elements of transit travel has led to significant discrepancies between model estimates and actual ridership. Additionally it does not allow decision-makers to test the effects of policies or investments that increase the capacity of a given transit service. This paper presents the framework adopted into a more recent version of SF-CHAMP (Fury) to represent transit capacity and crowding within the constraints of our current modeling software. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Vehicle ownership plays a key role in determining the number of trips made by a household and the modes that the household will use to make those trips. Predicting vehicle ownership is a challenge due to the complexity of relationships affecting the choice of vehicles for a particular household. The income of the household, the accessibility of activities by alternative modes, and the family makeup of a household all affect the choice of the number of vehicles. The Honolulu metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses the island of Oahu, is the primary study area. On Oahu, vehicle ownership varies widely, from the dense neighborhoods in Waikiki to the semirural areas on the fringe of the region. Consequently, the vehicle-ownership model will be a crucial component of the new travel forecasting models for the island. Using 1995 Oahu household interview survey data, a vehicle-ownership model that takes into account income, accessibility, and household family structure has been estimated and found to predict rather accurately the shares in each vehicle-ownership class by geography, household size, and number of workers. In addition, 1990 census data have been used to test a variation of the vehicle-ownership model on several other American cities such as Atlanta, Kansas City, San Francisco, and New York. The resulting models for these regions parallel the Honolulu vehicle-ownership model very closely in structure and statistical significance, thereby demonstrating the model structures' transferability between regions.},

abstract = {On August 1, 2007, the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis abruptly interrupted the usual route of about 140,000 daily vehicle trips, which substantially disturbed regular traffic flow patterns on the network. It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.},

abstract = {Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world{\&}{\#}039;s population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA.Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level ‘greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders.Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities.Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.},

The research shows that many failures occur due to well-known technical issues overlooked by management during the design process. Such failures are often termed errors and omissions. This research further indicates that systematic design quality control and quality assurance, careful communication, and post-design inspection are management techniques that could prevent a large number of engineering failures. In an effort to decrease the incidence of management issues, the authors propose to structure a prototypical standard of professional practice for design management. In developing that structure, the authors (1) explored the nature of standards and the similarities that exist in definitions by various professional organizations and (2) reviewed the standard of care and considered why it may not be...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks. METHODS In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities. RESULTS Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates. CONCLUSIONS Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.},

First, we give an overview of the general direction the spatial econometrics literature has taken without attempting to provide a representative survey of all interesting work that has appeared. Second, we identify a number of problems in spatial econometrics that are as yet unresolved. Finally, we provide advocacy for the notion that new spatial econometric theory should be inspired by actual empirical applications as opposed to being directed by what appears to be the most obvious extension of what is currently available.

@article{Koppelman2001b,
abstract = {This paper reviews and refutes three criticisms by Daly of earlier papers by Koppelman. and Wen (1998a. and b). The original papers identified important differences between two forms of the nested logit model. These differences between the Utility Maximizing Nested Logit (UMNL) and the Non-Normalized Nested Logit (NNNL) lead to important differences in model estimation, interpretation and prediction. We reaffirm the position that the NNNL model is not consistent with utility maximization unless normalized as recommended by Koppelman and Wen and challenge Daly's criticism of the earlier papers. First, Daly's hypothesis of the existence of an alternative behavioral theory, while correct in principle, is irrelevant to the question at hand, selection of a preferred model form, in the absence of an explicit theory. Second, the equivalence of the two models under special circumstances is consistent with Koppelman and Wen's recommendation for normalization of the NNNL model. Third, the argument that the NNNL has the advantage that it can estimate models which combine data from different sources is not correct as both model structures can estimate such models. Thus, we maintain the conclusion that the NNNL and UMNL models are distinct and the UMNL is preferred because of its consistency with established theories of behavior and social welfare.

abstract = {The integrated modeling of land use and transportation choices involves analyzing a continuum of choices that characterize people's lifestyles across temporal scales. This includes long-term choices such as residential and work location choices that affect land-use, medium-term choices such as vehicle ownership, and short-term choices such as travel mode choice that affect travel demand. Prior research in this area has been limited by the complexities associated with the development of integrated model systems that combine the long-, medium- and short-term choices into a unified analytical framework. This paper presents an integrated simultaneous multi-dimensional choice model of residential location, auto ownership, bicycle ownership, and commute tour mode choices using a mixed multidimensional choice modeling methodology. Model estimation results using the San Francisco Bay Area highlight a series of interdependencies among the multi-dimensional choice processes. The interdependencies include: (1) self-selection effects due to observed and unobserved factors, where households locate based on lifestyle and mobility preferences, (2) endogeneity effects, where any one choice dimension is not exogenous to another, but is endogenous to the system as a whole, (3) correlated error structures, where common unobserved factors significantly and simultaneously impact multiple choice dimensions, and (4) unobserved heterogeneity, where decision-makers show significant variation in sensitivity to explanatory variables due to unobserved factors. From a policy standpoint, to be able to forecast the 'true' causal influence of activity-travel environment changes on residential location, auto/bicycle ownership, and commute mode choices, it is necessary to capture the above-identified interdependencies by jointly modeling the multiple choice dimensions in an integrated framework.

@article{Huang2015,
abstract = {The advent of GIS and GPS has revolutionized how we monitor and model destination choice. New methodologies in building choice sets can be developed and new insights on travel behavior can be gained given the real-time GPS travel data. To this end, this research investigates how land use, road network structure, and axis of travel influence home-based, non-work destination choice based on in-vehicle GPS travel data in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area in 2008. We propose a novel choice set formation approach combining survival analysis and random selection and a new approach to deciding choice set size. Mixed-effects logit models are used to model our data with repeated observations for each participant. Our findings identify the following factors that influence non-work destination choice: (1) Walkable opportunities and diversity of services at destinations, (2) Route-specific factors such as turn index and speed discontinuity, and (3) Axis of travel measured by relative travel time to work, home, and downtown. A destination closer to the axis of home and work, all else equal, is more likely to be selected. A destination far away from downtown is more attractive to auto users. This research contributes to methodologies in building choice sets for modeling non-work destination choice. The results enhance our understanding of non-work destination choice and have implications for transportation and land use planning.},

@article{Kong2018,
abstract = {Over the past decade, much has been written about the potential of smart urbanism to bring about various and lasting forms of betterment. The embedding of digital technologies within urban infrastructures has been well documented, and the efficiencies of smart models of urban governance and management have been lauded. More recently, however, the discourse has been labelled 'hegemonic', and accused of developing a view of smart technology that is blinkered by its failure to critique its socio-political effects. By focusing on the case of Singapore's 'Smart Nation' initiative, this paper embraces the paradoxes at the heart of smart urbanism and, in doing so, interrogates the tension between ideology and praxis, efficiency and control, access and choice, and smart governance and smart citizenship. It also demonstrates how such tensions are (re)pro-duced through 'fourthspace' – the digitally enabled spaces of urbanism that are co-created, and that contribute to an expansion and diffusion of social and political responsibility. It ends by sug-gesting how such spaces have the potential to radically transform not just the urban environment, but also the role of government and citizens in designing urban futures.},

abstract = {The “back-to-the-city” phenomenon presented an unpredicted countercurrent in the prevalent tide of suburbanization, and this process of upper-income resettlement in the inner city has been thoroughly analyzed in the urban economic literature. Housing renovation, a process that always accompanies gentrification and constitutes a significant portion of residential housing investment, has been studied much less. Contrary to the expectation that “location matters,” the existing empirical studies have concluded that most neighborhood amenities and structural attributes are insignificant as determinants of renovation. Using a detailed parcel-level data set that documents all residential renovation activity in Chicago between 1995 and 2000, this paper establishes that the characteristics of a building and its neighborhood do indeed influence the likelihood that it will be renovated.},

@article{Dobruszkes2011,
abstract = {Increasingly air transport growth raises the question of its impact on the environment. Public authorities and researchers are relying more and more on high-speed trains (HSTs), whose efficiency is supposed to lead to a modal shift from airplanes. However, most transport studies focus on the evolution of demand rather than supply, although it is basically the latter that determines environmental damage. In light of this fact, this paper aims to compare the overall dynamics in the supply of air transport in Europe compared to the HST supply and to examine empirically five city-pairs. The development of high-speed rail remains limited compared to the increase of air services. For a given city-pair, the decline in the number of flights depends on various conditions, including length of the HST journey and the strategies adopted by the airlines. Some carriers reduce their supply in terms of the number of seats but increase the number of flights in order to compete more effectively with the HSTs. Moreover, the competition between low-cost airlines and HSTs should be kept in mind and re-examined in a few years.},

abstract = {The expansion of high-speed passenger rail service is often argued as a potentially effective, lower-carbon substitute for intercity air travel. Previous studies on the impact of high-speed rail on air travel in Europe and Asia have primarily examined the impact of travel time and price on market share for a specific city pair (or a handful of city pairs). There has been little focus on the extent to which high-speed rail (HSR) has reduced total short-haul air travel demand (versus market share), or on the potential impacts of high-speed rail on system-wide air travel demand. This paper presents an empirical, econometric analysis of air travel demand in Europe, utilizing an expanded data set to explore: (1) the impact of rail travel times, population density, and market characteristics on air traffic; and (2) the impact of high-speed rail and low-cost-carriers on system-wide air traffic. Although improvements in rail travel times have resulted in reductions in short-haul air travel, variations in city and airport characteristics significantly influence the substitution between air and rail. This paper also finds that HSR substitution has resulted in a modest reduction in system-wide air travel demand, whereas the expansion of low-cost carriers has led to a significant increase in total European air traffic. As concerns about the climate impacts of transportation grow, these results have significant implications for future transport and energy policy.},

abstract = {Weight matrices, such as used in network autocorrelation models, are useful to investigate social influence processes. The objective of this paper is to investigate a key topic that has received relatively little attention in previous research, namely the issues that arise when observational limitations lead to measurement errors in these weight matrices. Measurement errors are investigated from two perspectives: when relevant ties are omitted, and when irrelevant ties are erroneously included as part of the matrix. The paper first shows analytically that these two situations result in biased estimates. Next, a simulation experiment provides evidence of the effect of erroneously coding the weight matrix on model performance and the ability of a network autocorrelation test to identify social influence effects. The results suggest that depending on the level of autocorrelation and the topology attributes of the underlying matrix, there is a window of opportunity to identify and model social influence processes even in situations where the ties in a matrix cannot be accurately observed.},

Because differences in performance may be due to differences in data. we compare the methods using a single data set. The estimation methods include simple OLS, a two-stage process incorporating nearest neighbors' residuals in the second stage, geostatistical, and trend surface models. These models take into account submarkets by adding dummy variables or by estimating separate equations for each submarket. Based on data for approximately 13,000 transactions from Louisville. Kentucky, we conclude that a geostatistical model with disaggregated submarket variables performs best. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The paper aims to analyse and compare synthetic indices of accessibility in order to measure the impact of high-speed trains on European cities. In particular, it considers the data and results concerning two previous articles by Guti{\'{e}}rrez et al. and Mart{\'{i}}n et al. that analyse the accessibility gains produced by the construction of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-Ts). In these two papers, accessibility is studied using, first, a partial approach with three different indicators: location, potential market, and daily accessibility; and, second, data envelopment analysis (DEA) to calculate a synthetic index of global accessibility. The present paper extends these studies by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a new synthetic accessibility index. DEA and PCA are two good candidates to synthesize the partial information provided by different methods that have been employed in the previous literature that studies accessibility. It is shown that DEA and PCA methodologies yield a consistent ranking for the global accessibility of the European cities for three different scenarios: 1996, 2005 and 2015. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper explores the impact of residential density on households' vehicle type and usage choices using the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Attempts to quantify the effect of urban form on households' vehicle choice and utilization often encounter the problem of sample selectivity. Household characteristics that are unobservable to the researchers might determine simultaneously where to live, what vehicles to choose, and how much to drive them. Unless this simultaneity is modeled, any relationship between residential density and vehicle choice may be biased. This paper extends the Bayesian multivariate ordered probit and tobit model developed in Fang (2008) to treat local residential density as endogenous. The model includes equations for vehicle ownership and usage in terms of number of cars, number of trucks (vans, sports utility vehicles, and pickup trucks), miles traveled by cars, and miles traveled by trucks. We carry out policy simulations that show that an increase in residential density has a negligible effect on car choice and utilization, but slightly reduces truck choice and utilization. The largest impact we find is a -.4 arc elasticity of truck fuel use with respect to density. We also perform an out-of-sample forecast using a holdout sample to test the robustness of the model.},

abstract = {Public transit accounts for only 1{\%} of U.S. passenger miles traveled but nevertheless attracts strong public support. Using a simple choice model, we predict that transit riders are likely to be individuals who commute along routes with the most severe roadway delays. These individuals' choices thus have very high marginal impacts on congestion. We test this prediction with data from a sudden strike in 2003 by Los Angeles transit workers. Estimating a regression discontinuity design, we find that average highway delay increases 47{\%} when transit service ceases. This effect is consistent with our model's predictions and many times larger than earlier estimates, which have generally concluded that public transit provides minimal congestion relief. We find that the net benefits of transit systems appear to be much larger than previously believed.},

abstract = {The Singapore government has adopted a policy, the short-run objective of which was to relieve congestion in the central city, and the long-run objective, to persuade motorists to reconsider their attitudes toward automobile ownership and use. The policy instrument selected was a form of congestion pricing called area licensing, and its goal was to reduce peak-hour traffic by 25-30{\%}. Under lying the license scheme was the concept that a special supplementary license had to be obtained and displayed if a motorist wished to enter a designated restricted area within which congestion was to be reduced. The first task was to delimit the boundary of the restricted zone; the second, to set the license fee. The license requirement does not apply to buses or commercial vehicles. A park-and-ride scheme was designed to complement the area license scheme. The third element of the scheme was an increase of about 100{\%} in public parking changes within the restricted zone, and a surcharge on private parking lot operators. The monitoring of the impact of the scheme is described as well as the effect on unrestricted traffic. Comments are also made on some of the problems that were encountered in the implementation of the plan. All preliminary observations and analyses indicate that the scheme has been very successful in reducing traffic in restricted zones during hours of restriction. Benefits have accrued to some car drivers, and the administration and enforcement of the scheme has been manageable.},

New strategies for primary and secondary disease prevention are desperately needed to aid in blunting the negative economic and social impact of these diseases. Physical activity (PA) and exercise are now considered principal interventions for use in primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases. Currently, more emphasis in primary prevention of disease is necessary to reduce disease risk in youth and adults; however with chronic disease prevalence so high, similar emphasis is also necessary for secondary prevention in those children and adults already inflicted with chronic diseases. Conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer are drastically improved when PA and exercise are part of a medical management plan. In addition, the national PA guidelines in conjunction with PA promotion tools like Exercise is Medicine™ are needed to promote increased PA and exercise levels worldwide.},

abstract = {This paper aims to analyse the wider spatial-economic impacts of high-speed trains (HSTs) within post-industrial regions. A core question underlies the analysis: can HST effects spread from the core city to surrounding sub-regions, or could they widen the gap between core and peripheral places? A comparative case study of two regions – Manchester and its sub-regions in North West England (UK) and Lille and its sub-regions in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France) – with similar industrial trajectories and opportunities allied to two different HST approaches was conducted to offer crucial insights. The findings showed that for both regions, the arrival of HSTs did assist the development towards the knowledge economy, but the specific aspects vary. Also, the differential effects existed: the connection with the national capital by faster train services did economically strengthen the regional capital, but not some sub-regions around it, especially former industrial sub-regions. The comparison between the two regions shows that the transformation of post-industrial regions and sub-regions towards the knowledge economy brought by HSTs proves a complex and difficult process. Both post-industrial regions are still in the course of transition. In Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the wider economic transformation is just beginning to happen, while the laboriously-upgraded West Coast Main Line seems to demonstrate limits to its transformative power. This process involves much more than being connected with highspeed trains, significant as this may be. A full investigation of causality deserves another paper, but the findings suggested three critical factors: the economic trajectory and its infrastructure needs, a HST hub strategy and the simultaneous improvement of the intra-regional transport network, and path dependency.},

abstract = {Trip-based approach and activity-based approach are two extremes in the use of activity related information when developing travel demand models. Creating lifestyle clusters for a population is a compromise between the two. On the one hand, it has taken into account travel-activity patterns in the development of the clusters. On the other hand, the clusters represent homogenous groups of individuals and simple activity-based travel demand models can be developed for each cluster. However, the development of such clusters requires knowledge of activity-travel patterns of individuals, which can only be obtained from a large-scale survey. It is still an open question how to create travel/activity- related lifestyle clusters using readily available socio-demographic data (such as census data) alone. This paper attempts to answer this question by proposing a procedure of lifestyle classification that moves from specific surveys to a general population. This paper first studies issues related to the development of homogeneous clusters using socioeconomic, demographic and activity-travel data. The second part of the paper addresses the issue of data insufficiency and points out that in order to use the clusters developed for travel demand estimation, it is important to know how to allocate individuals in the population to the developed clusters. As a first attempt, this paper proposes to use a recently developed technique called, Support Vector Machine (SVM), to develop classification functions that based on readily available information only. The methodologies proposed are applied to a sub-urban area in Hong Kong. Six lifestyle clusters are first produced using factor analysis and cluster analysis. SVM is then used to develop classification functions that are based on fewer variables. Results show that the two sets of lifestyle clusters are similar and that the SVM outperforms other traditional classification methods.},

abstract = {Although vegetation has been positively linked to fear of crime and crime in a number of settings, recent findings in urban residential areas have hinted at a possible negative relationship: Residents living in “greener” surroundings report lower levels of fear, fewer incivilities, and less aggressive and violent behavior. This study used police crime reports to examine the relationship between vegetation and crime in an inner-city neighborhood. Crime rates for 98 apartment buildings with varying levels of nearby vegetation were compared. Results indicate that although residents were randomly assigned to different levels of nearby vegetation, the greener a building's surroundings were, the fewer crimes reported. Furthermore, this pattern held for both property crimes and violent crimes. The relationship of vegetation to crime held after the number of apartments per building, building height, vacancy rate, and number of occupied units per building were accounted for.},

abstract = {Recently, GPS (Global Positioning System) technologies have been increasingly used in various applications of transportation planning and operations. When combined with GIS (geographic information systems), GPS data can be matched with spatial map features such as highways and roads for monitoring traffic conditions on those links. As one such application, GISTT (GPS-GIS integrated system for travel time surveys) was developed. GISTT collects and analyses traffic conditions of links by monitoring speed of probe vehicle(s) and then estimates travel time data both in static and dynamic modes. The static mode refers to the case of offline processing of GPS data from previously dispatched GPS-equipped vehicles to specified road links. The dynamic mode refers to the real time monitoring of speed on the links using a GPS-wireless Internet-equipped probe vehicle. GISTT is tested in various field tests and the results are found to be promising. Furthermore, the GISTT is to be extended by incorporating more complex dynamic algorithms to provide reliable real time traffic conditions. This paper sets a framework of the extended GISTT that contains algorithm to monitor traffic conditions by processing massive data from multiple GPS probes or GPS-enabled-cell-phones in real time. The algorithm involves identifying the traveling mode based on patterns found in relatively short time frame},

Competition with other modes needs to be evaluated, especially as regards travelling times and fares, with special attention paid to domestic airlines. For new trains, gains in travelling times and lower operational costs can be expected. Model calculations of operational costs for domestic air stages and high-speed trains, respectively, show that high-speed trains have lower costs per available seat kilometer. Train operators can meet competition with fares from coaches and air carriers provided they introduce yield management. The primary competition is about travelling times.

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a potentially disruptive yet beneficial change to our transportation system. This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach {\$}2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly {\$}4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.},

@article{Ernstson2013,
abstract = {A framework is constructed for how to relate ecosystem services to environmental justice. The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing “out there”, but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban ‘green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity—what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework.},

abstract = {Parks are valuable resources for physical activity (PA) given their widespread availability and low cost to maintain and use. Both proximity to parks and the availability of particular features are important correlates of PA. However, few studies have explored multiple measures of proximity simultaneously or the specific facilities associated with park use and park-based PA among adults, let alone differences across socio-demographic characteristics. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between park proximity and park facilities and adults' park use and park-based PA, while also exploring differences by gender, age, race, and income. Data on monthly park use and weekly amount of PA undertaken in parks were collected via a mail survey of adults from randomly-selected households (n = 893) in Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO) in 2010–2011. Three measures of park proximity were calculated within 1 mile of participating households: distance to the closest park, number of parks, and total park area. All parks in KCMO were audited using the Community Park Audit Tool to determine the availability of 14 park facilities within 1 mile of each participant (e.g., trail, playground, tennis court). Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between each of park use and park-based PA and 1) three measures of park proximity, and 2) the availability of 14 park facilities within 1 mile of participants. Separate analyses were conducted by gender, age, race, and income, while controlling for all socio-demographic characteristics and BMI. Across all sub-samples, distance to the closest park was not significantly related to either park use or park-based PA. However, numerous significant associations were found for the relationship of number of parks and amount of park space within 1 mile with both outcomes. As well, diverse facilities were associated with park use and park-based PA. For both park proximity and facilities, the significant relationships varied widely across gender, age, race, and income groups. Both park proximity and park facilities are related to park use and park-based PA. Understanding how such associations vary across demographic groups is important in planning for activity-friendly parks that are responsive to the needs of neighborhood residents.},

abstract = {High-Speed Rail (HSR) infrastructure is costly and requires high investment during the construction and operation periods, which is mainly financed with public funds. This economic effort is seldom set off, which leads to subsidies with the money collected from public debt growth or tax pressure increases. The question that immediately emerges is whether the entrance of this new infrastructure generates economic spillovers at the local level and, consequently, improves local public budgets. To solve this question we use local data on economic activity, municipalities׳ characteristics and local financial data in Spain for the past decade (2001–2010). Our estimations by difference-in-difference analysis and using spatial data yield a general conclusion: when HSR comes to town, both local revenues and the local fiscal gap improve by mean 10{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively. These improvements primarily affect municipalities located within 5km of an HSR station.},

Public transport frequency has a positive whereas travel time has a negative effect on the choice of departure stations accessed by public transport. The derived rail service quality index (RSQI), which provides a measure of rail accessibility to all other stations, has a significant and positive effect on the choice of departure stations accessed by all modes.

We have investigated whether there is a synergistic benefit in adopting physical activities whilst being directly exposed to nature (‘green exercise'). Five groups of 20 subjects were exposed to a sequence of 30 scenes projected on a wall whilst exercising on a treadmill. Four categories of scenes were tested: rural pleasant, rural unpleasant, urban pleasant and urban unpleasant. The control was running without exposure to images. Blood pressure and two psychological measures (self-esteem and mood) were measured before and after the intervention. There was a clear effect of both exercise and different scenes on blood pressure, self-esteem and mood. Exercise alone significantly reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and had a positive significant effect on 4 of 6 mood measures.

abstract = {The structure of transportation networks and the patterns of accessibility they give rise to are an important determinant of land prices, and hence urban spatial structure. While there is ample evidence on the cross-sectional relationship between location and land value (usually measured from the value of improved property), there is much less evidence available on the changes in this relationship over time, especially where location is represented using a disaggregate mea- sure of urban accessibility. This paper provides evidence of this dynamic relationship using data on home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MN) metropolitan area, coupled with disag- gregate measures of urban accessibility for multiple modes, for the period from 2000 to 2005. Our investigation seeks to track the effects of marginal changes in accessibility over time, as opposed to static, cross-sectional relationships, by using an unconventional approach in which the unit of observation is a “representative house” for each transportation analysis zone in the region. This approach allows us to control for changes in structural attributes of houses over time, while also isolating the effect of changes in accessibility levels. Results of this approach are compared to a cross-sectional model using the same variables for a single year to illustrate important differences. These differences are discussed in terms of their implications for prac- titioners and for further investigations of the relationship between transportation, location and land value.},

abstract = {The objectives of this research by the Texas Department of Transportation were to determine the variables that affect the speeds of free-flow turning vehicles in an exclusive right-turn lane and explore the safety experience of different right-turn lane designs. The evaluations found that the variables affecting the turning speed at an exclusive right-turn lane include type of channelization present (either lane line or raised island), lane length, and corner radius. Variables that affect the turning speed at an exclusive right-turn lane with island design include (a) radius, lane length, and island size at the beginning of the turn and (b) corner radius, lane length, and turning-roadway width near the middle of the turn. Researchers for a Georgia study concluded that treatments that had the highest number of crashes were right-turn lanes with raised islands. This type of intersection had the second highest number of crashes of the treatments evaluated in Texas. In both studies, the "shared through with right lane combination" had the lowest number of crashes. These findings need to be verified through use of a larger, more comprehensive study that includes right-turning volume.},

@article{Rietveld1994,
abstract = {This paper contains a survey of studies on the spatial economic impacts of transport infrastructure supply. A theoretical framework is developed where impacts of transport infrastructure on spatial economic development are measured in terms of productivity changes and (re)location behaviour. The transmission takes place via changes in generalized transport costs and accessibility. Methods for analyzing transport infrastructure impacts are classified according to the level of aggregation of the data (aggregate versus disaggregate) and the degree of model use (modelling versus nonmodelling approaches). Two spatial levels are distinguished: intra-urban versus intraregional. At the intraregional level it is found that integrated land use-transport models usually yield infrastructure impacts of limited size. Much larger impacts are usually found when entrepreneurs are directly interviewed about these impacts as they perceive them. At the interregional level, production function approaches usually lead to the conclusion that infrastructure supply has a considerable impact on the productivity of other production factors. On the other hand, the relocation impacts of transport infrastructure on economic activity as predicted by multiregional models are usually limited.},

abstract = {This paper examines the announcement effects on property values of a large, multipurpose development initiative in Atlanta, Georgia called the “Beltline” which has received substantial public attention. The project involves the redevelopment of an abandoned rail line that encircles the central area of Atlanta. The 6500-acre project will be funded by tax increment fi nancing bonds and will include the development of light rail, greenspace and real estate projects. By examining home sales from 2000 to 2006, the paper identifi es changes in price premiums for locations in various geographical buffers around the Beltline and compares the timing of such changes with coverage in the local newspaper. It is found that there are large increases in premiums for homes near the lower-income, southside parts of the Beltline TIF district between 2003 and 2005, which corresponds to the initial media coverage of the planning process. The fi ndings suggest that planning for the Beltline induced substantial speculation and gentrifi cation.},

abstract = {Proximity to transportation infrastructure (highways and public transit) influences residential real estate values. Housing values also are influ- enced by propinquity to a shopping facility or a recreational amenity. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) models were used to estimate the impact of locational elements on the price of residential properties sold during 1995 in the Greater Toronto Area. A large data set consisting of 27,400 free- hold sales was used in the study. Moran's I was estimated to determine the effects of spatial autocorrelation that existed in housing values. SAR models, using a combination of locational influences, neighborhood char- acteristics, and structural attributes, explained 83 percent variance in housing values. Using the “comparable sales approach,” a spatiotempo- ral lag variable was estimated for every property in the database. This research discovered that SAR models offered a better fit than nonspatial models. This study also discovered that in the presence of other explana- tory variables, locational and transportation factors were not strong determinants of housing values. On the other hand, the number of wash- rooms and the average household income in a neighborhood were found to be significant determinants of housing values. Stepwise regression techniques were used to determine reduced spatial hedonic models.},

abstract = {Research that attempts to characterize urban form is confronted with two key issues: criticism of the use of aggregate units of analysis, such as census tracts, and a general lack of consideration of variables related to elements other than the built environment, such as residents' behavior. This methodological study explores the impact of travel behavior variables in the quantitative characterization of urban form at the census tract level for the Montreal region. Two separate factor-cluster analyses are performed: the first includes built-environment variables commonly used to typify areas within a region, and a second includes additional travel behavior variables. The results of both models are compared to satellite images to determine which analysis more accurately represents the reality on the ground. The results provide empirical evidence that travel behavior variables, in addition to built form, provide a more accurate representation of urban form at the census tract level. These variables refine the model output by moderating the effect of features that generally led to misleading results. This effect is particularly evident in areas represented by large census tracts. These results suggest that considering both built environment and behavioral characteristics in an analysis of urban form yields more precise results at the (aggregate) census tract level. The findings from this study could be helpful for engineers and planners when conducting property value studies, urban investment analysis, and policy intervention prioritization and when expanding the well-known land use classification of urban and rural categories.},

@article{Wee2007,
abstract = {Decision making with respect to large infrastructure projects is at least partly based on ex ante evaluations of costs and impacts. Impacts include economic, environmental, and social impacts, sometimes aggregated in a cost – benefit analysis (CBA). For such ex ante evaluations the quality of the related demand and costs forecasts is very important. This paper aims to answer four questions: (1) What is the quality of demand forecasts for large infrastructure projects? (2) What is the quality of cost forecasts for these projects? (3) How can current practices with respect to assessing the demand and cost forecasts be improved? (4) Which implications do the insights have for practice, and which challenges for future research can be derived from the findings? A literature review is used to answer the first three questions. It is concluded that the quality of transport demand and costs forecasts is often very poor, especially for rail projects. This is not so much a lack of adequate forecasting techniques or a matter of insight into the factors determining costs, but more the strategic behaviour of some actors. Improvements therefore should not only be looked for in the area of transport demand and cost-estimation methodologies, but should also focus on the question of how strategic behaviour can be avoided or at least limited. These conclusions are very important for CBA because cost underestimations and demand overestimations have a major impact on the cost – benefit ratio and decrease the potentially positive impact of CBA on the quality of decision making. The paper discusses several challenges for related future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, a destination choice model with pairwise district-level constants is proposed for trip distribution based on a nearly complete OD trip matrix in a region. It is found that the coefficients are weakly identified in a destination choice model with pairwise zone-level constants. Thus, a destination choice model with pairwise district-level constants is then proposed and an iterative algorithm is developed for model estimation. Herein, the “district” means a spatial aggregation of a number of zones. The proposed model is demonstrated through simulation experiments. Then, destination choice models with and without pairwise district-level constants are estimated based on GPS data of taxi passenger trips collected during morning peak hours within the Inner Ring Road of Shanghai, China. The datasets comprise 504,187 trip records and a sample of 10,000 taxi trips for model development. The zones used in the study are actually 961 residents' committees while the districts are 52 residential districts that are spatial aggregations and upper-level administrative units of residents' committees. It is found that the estimated value of time dramatically drops after the involvement of district-level constants, indicating that the traditional model tends to overestimate the value of time when ignoring pairwise associations between two zones in trip distribution. The proposed destination choice model can ensure its predicted trip OD matrix to match the observed one at district level. Thus, the proposed model has potential to be widely applied for trip distribution under the situation where a complete OD trip matrix can be observed.},

Examples of integrative projects are discussed in the areas of sustainability metrics and integration of industrial, societal, and environmental impacts. It is clear that a focus on green engineering that employs pollution prevention and industrial ecology alone are not sufficient to achieve sustainability, because even systems with efficient material and energy use can overwhelm the carrying capacity of a region or lead to other socially unacceptable outcomes.

abstract = {This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the application of smart card fare payment data to public transportation planning. The research objective is to identify and assess complete, multimodal journeys using Oyster smart card fare payment data in London. Three transfer combinations (bus-to-Underground, Underground-to-bus, and bus-to-bus) are considered to formulate recommendations for maximum elapsed time thresholds to identify transfers between journey stages for each passenger on the London network. Recommended elapsed time thresholds for identifying transfers are 20 min for Underground-to-bus, 35 min for bus-to-Underground, and 45 min for bus-to-bus, but a range of values that account for variability across the network are also assessed. Key findings about bus and Underground travel in London include an average of 2.3 daily public transportation journeys per passenger, 1.3 journey stages per public transportation journey, and 23{\%} of Underground journeys involving a transfer to or from a bus. The application of complete journey data to bus network planning is used to illustrate the value of new information that would be available to network planners through the use of smart card fare payment data.},

abstract = {Residential mobility and relocation choice are essential parts of integrated transportation and land use models. These decision processes have been examined and modeled individually to a great extent but there remain gaps in the literature on the underlying behaviors that connect them. Households may partly base their decision to move from or stay at a current location on the price and quality of the available alternatives. Conversely, households that are on the market for a new location may evaluate housing choices relative to their previous residence. How and the degree to which these decisions relate to each other are, however, not completely understood. This research is intended to contribute to the body of empirical evidence that will help answer these questions. It is hypothesized that residential mobility and location choice are related household decisions that can be modeled together using a two-tier hierarchical structure. This paper presents a novel nested logit (NL) model with sampling of alternatives and a proposed procedure for sampling bias correction. The model was estimated using fullinformation maximum likelihood estimation methods. The results confirm the applicability of this NL model and support similar findings from other empirical studies in the residential mobility and location choice literature.},

Our focus is on disaggregate simulators that represent every traveler individually. We calibrate, also at an individual level, arbitrary choice dimensions within a Bayesian framework, where the analyst's prior knowledge is represented by the dynamic traffic simulator itself and the measurements are comprised of time-dependent traffic counts. The approach is equally applicable to an equilibrium-based planning model and to a telematics model of spontaneous and imperfectly informed drivers. It is based on consistent mathematical arguments, yet it is applicable in a purely simulation-based environment and, as our experimental results show, is capable of handling large scenarios.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Studies have shown that exposure to the natural environment, or so-called green space, has an independent effect on health and health-related behaviours. We postulated that income-related inequality in health would be less pronounced in populations with greater exposure to green space, since access to such areas can modify pathways through which low socioeconomic position can lead to disease. METHODS We classified the population of England at younger than retirement age (n=40 813 236) into groups on the basis of income deprivation and exposure to green space. We obtained individual mortality records (n=366 348) to establish whether the association between income deprivation, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality (circulatory disease, lung cancer, and intentional self-harm) in 2001–05, varied by exposure to green space measured in 2001, with control for potential confounding factors. We used stratified models to identify the nature of this variation. FINDINGS The association between income deprivation and mortality differed significantly across the groups of exposure to green space for mortality from all causes (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and circulatory disease (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0212), but not from lung cancer or intentional self-harm. Health inequalities related to income deprivation in all-cause mortality and mortality from circulatory diseases were lower in populations living in the greenest areas. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for all-cause mortality for the most income deprived quartile compared with the least deprived was 1{\textperiodcentered}93 (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}86–2{\textperiodcentered}01) in the least green areas, whereas it was 1{\textperiodcentered}43 (1{\textperiodcentered}34–1{\textperiodcentered}53) in the most green. For circulatory diseases, the IRR was 2{\textperiodcentered}19 (2{\textperiodcentered}04–2{\textperiodcentered}34) in the least green areas and 1{\textperiodcentered}54 (1{\textperiodcentered}38–1{\textperiodcentered}73) in the most green. There was no effect for causes of death unlikely to be affected by green space, such as lung cancer and intentional self-harm. INTERPRETATION Populations that are exposed to the greenest environments also have lowest levels of health inequality related to income deprivation. Physical environments that promote good health might be important to reduce socioeconomic health inequalities. FUNDING None.},

This paper shows that by taking advantage of an equivalent relation between the CLM and Poisson regression likelihood functions one can more effectively control for the potential IIA violation in complex choice scenarios where the decision maker confronts a large number of narrowly defined spatial alternatives. As demonstrated here our approach to the IIA problem is compliant with the random utility (profit) maximization framework.},

abstract = {Market segmentation studies in travel behavior research are ordinarily based on socioeconomic characteristics and personality traits. This study explores the usefulness of a different approach, where the actual overall mobility levels across different ground transportation modes, along with desired changes in the use of cars and transit, are used as clustering variables. Using a given mode can in fact influence the personal representation of that mode, which in turn has been proven to be a key element in transport behaviours. We form such multimodality-based clusters from two field studies, one involving employees of the French transportation research institute INRETS and the other a representative sample of residents of the US San Francisco Bay Area. We find that strong users of a given mode would like to bring more balance to their ‘‘modal consumptions'' by decreasing the use of this mode more than the average, and increasing the use of the alternative mode. However, concerning ground transport travel budgets, the desire to travel more (or less) overall seems less strongly related to the composition of the modal balance. The US dataset shows also a greater latent demand for travel than the French one. Socioeconomic characteristics of the clusters could not explain the patterns that were found, confirming the importance of taking into account multimodality issues in travel behavior research. Some policy implications from these findings are finally reported.},

abstract = {The delay of right-turning vehicles at intersections is an important but little-studied aspect of traffic intersection operations. Several different physical treatments can be applied to right turns, including turn lanes, turn channels, and free right-turn (RT) channels with auxiliary lanes exiting the intersection. It is believed that improvements such as these will alleviate RT delay at intersections. Yet motorists still frequently yield to oncoming vehicles in conditions that permit them proceed without delay. In order to study how drivers behave at RT channels, right-turning vehicles at two "free right-turn" channelized intersections in Utah County, Utah, were video-recorded for statistical analyses. The vehicles were observed to yield to oncoming vehicles even when no actual conflict existed. Linear and logarithmic regression models predict that each vehicle in a free RT channel experiences 2 seconds of delay for every oncoming vehicle. Existing traffic models fail to incorporate this delay into their algorithms, often leading to an underestimation of delay at RT channels. These findings are important in two major ways. First, it is recommended the Transportation Research Board and other entities consider ways to refine how RT behavior is modeled and simulated to more accurately reflect imperfect motorist understanding and behavior. Second, municipalities and departments of transportation should re-evaluate the decision to install free RT channels, especially free RT channels, because the benefits of the treatment may not be significantly greater than other RT alternatives.},

@article{Cantillo2018,
abstract = {Transportation networks and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters. During disaster response operations, the degraded functionality of the system can negatively impact the affected population because disrupting relief activitiesincreases human suffering resulting from the lack of access to essential goods or services. Mathematical formulations for assessing transportation network vulnerability do not generally consider this lack of access or deprivation costs, and can lead to inappropriate strategies for humanitarian assistance. This paper proposes a transportation network vulnerability assessment model that allows identifying critical links for the development of high impact disaster response operations. The model is based on an economic analysis that considers the logistical costs of the distribution operations and the external effects derived from the delays in the provision of basic supplies (deprivation costs). The approach is particularly useful for planning resilient disaster response plans in the preparednessstage, prioritizing investment for mitigation and adaptation, and prioritizing the rehabilitation (access restoration) of the disrupted links in the response and recovery stages. In addition to numerical experiments using case study networks, the authors implemented the model to the coffee-producing region of Colombia, which was hit by an earthquake in 1999.},

@article{Logan2017,
abstract = {We revisit the standard methodology for evaluating proximity to urban services and recommend enhancements to address existing limitations. Existing approaches often simplify their measure of proximity by using large areal units and by imposing arbitrary distance thresholds. By doing so, these approaches risk overlooking vulnerable, access-poor populations – the very populations that such studies are often trying to identify. These limitations are primarily motivated by computational constraints. However, recent advances in computational power, open data, and open-source analytics permit high-resolution proximity analyses on large scales. Given the impetus for equitable accessibility in our communities, this is of fundamental importance for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages these open source advances to (a) measure proximity using network distance at the building level, (b) estimate population at that level, and (c) present the resulting distributions so vu...},

abstract = {Land use transport interaction (LUTI) models are often developed to model the interaction between the land use and trans- port systems for relatively large-scale spatial developments, like new residential or office areas, new main roads, or railway lines. In this paper I argue that we need a next generation of LUTI models that model trends such as peak car; decline in population, shops, services, etc.; impact of information and communications technology (ICT) on activity patterns and travel; and cycling policies. The current genera- tion of LUTI models cannot adequately answer the policy questions raised by these trends. However, a major problem is that the future of these trends is uncertain, and we lack empirical research into the dynamics between these trends and their wider impact on land use and transport systems. Nevertheless, LUTI models can, by utilizing what-if calculations, help explore future trends and their implications. Other challenges for LUTI models include the calculation of a wider set of accessibility indicators, the inclusion of interactions between key ac- tors in the transport and land-use system—serious gaming may prove a useful way to explore these interactions—and the development of dynamic visualizations.},

The simulation results indicate that we may be able to eliminate up to 90{\%} of parking demand for clients who adopt the system, at a low market penetration rate of 2{\%}. The results also suggest that different SAV operation strategies and client's preferences may lead to different spatial distribution of urban parking demand.},

The model system represents a person's choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary – most important – activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary – additional – tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

The former values features implying a natural or less intense use, and the latter values features adding “intensity or utility to a property” (8).

abstract = {A growing body of research shows affluent White neighborhoods have more acres of parks and more park facilities than low-income ethnic minority communities in many Global North cities. Most of these investigations focused on neighborhood-level differences and did not analyze broader inequities across cities. This is a particularly significant limitation in the U.S., where changes in the political economy of parks due to a reduced local tax base have led cities to compete against each other to secure park funding from national nonprofits and public agencies. To address this gap, we examined whether the quality of urban park systems – measured through The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore – varies depending on a city's median income and ethnic composition. Based on multivariate regressions in which we control for features of the urban fabric, we found U.S. cities with higher median incomes and lower percentages of Latino and Non-Hispanic Black residents have higher ParkScores than other cities. Some inequities also emerged for park coverage, park spending per person, and park facilities, with majority-Latino cities being particularly disadvantaged. These findings echo the results of neighborhood-level studies in Global North contexts, suggesting neighborhood-level inequities in park provision might scale up to inequities across cities. This study contributes to environmental justice theory and advocacy by demonstrating the importance of scaling up analyses of park provision to cross-city comparisons. Implications for landscape planning, public policy, and grant-making are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Well-designed public open space (POS) that encourages physical activity is a community asset that could potentially contribute to the health of local residents. METHODS In 1995–1996, two studies were conducted—an environmental audit of POS over 2 acres (n =516) within a 408-km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia; and personal interviews with 1803 adults (aged 18 to 59 years) (52.9{\%} response rate). The association between access to POS and physical activity was examined using three accessibility models that progressively adjusted for distance to POS, and its attractiveness and size. In 2002, an observational study examined the influence of attractiveness on the use of POS by observing users of three pairs of high- and low-quality (based on attractiveness) POS matched for size and location. RESULTS Overall, 28.8{\%} of respondents reported using POS for physical activity. The likelihood of using POS increased with increasing levels of access, but the effect was greater in the model that adjusted for distance, attractiveness, and size. After adjustment, those with very good access to large, attractive POS were 50{\%} more likely to achieve high levels of walking (odds ratio, 1.50; 95{\%} confidence level, 1.06–2.13). The observational study showed that after matching POS for size and location, 70{\%} of POS users observed visited attractive POS. CONCLUSIONS Access to attractive, large POS is associated with higher levels of walking. To increase walking, thoughtful design (and redesign) of POS is required that creates large, attractive POS with facilities that encourage active use by multiple users (e.g., walkers, sports participants, picnickers).},

abstract = {Parks and recreation departments and public health organizations both work to improve the well-being of their communities. Measuring residential proximity to parks could be a specific area of shared interest, given that proximity to parks is needed for walking access, and the use of parks is, in turn, associated with many physical, social, and mental health benefits. The CDC's publicly available National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (NEPHTN) Access to Parks Indicator (API) focuses on one major component of access, residential proximity to parks. The API uses a commercial parks database and U.S. Census data to estimate the number and percentage of individuals in the U.S. that live within a half-mile of a park boundary, a measure commonly used to represent park proximity. The API is calculated at the state and county levels and is available for all states and counties in the U.S. Using estimates from the API, we examined the distribution of residential proximity to parks by geography and race/ethnicity. Additionally, we evaluated differences in park proximity by rural/urban status of counties. In 2010, 39{\%} of the total U.S. population lived within a half-mile of a park. This percentage varied widely between states, ranging from 9{\%} in West Virginia to 67{\%} in Hawaii and 88{\%} in the District of Columbia (DC). Park proximity was lowest among non-Hispanic whites (34.2{\%}) and highest among individuals belonging to the non-Hispanic other race category (52.0{\%}). Metropolitan counties had the highest percentage of residents living within a half-mile of a park (43.3{\%}); the percentage was lower in non-metropolitan counties adjacent to a metropolitan county (15.0{\%}) and non-metropolitan counties not adjacent to a metropolitan county (18.5{\%}). Park proximity was higher in metropolitan counties with a larger population size and in non-metropolitan counties with a higher degree of urbanization. The NEPHTN Access to Parks Indicator provides an opportunity to understand park proximity in counties and states throughout the U.S., including identifying disparities that may exist between population subgroups and comparing geographic areas. Parks and recreational professionals can use this information to compare their county or state to other geographic areas and, in combination with local data on parks within their jurisdiction, inform decisions to improve the distribution of parks and the well-being of their communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Several recent studies have identified a relationship between the natural environment and improved health outcomes. However, for practical reasons, most have been observational, cross-sectional studies. PURPOSE A natural experiment, which provides stronger evidence of causality, was used to test whether a major change to the natural environment—the loss of 100 million trees to the emerald ash borer, an invasive forest pest—has influenced mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory diseases. METHODS Two fixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the relationship between emerald ash borer presence and county-level mortality from 1990 to 2007 in 15 U.S. states, while controlling for a wide range of demographic covariates. Data were collected from 1990 to 2007, and the analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012. RESULTS There was an increase in mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory-tract illness in counties infested with the emerald ash borer. The magnitude of this effect was greater as infestation progressed and in counties with above-average median household income. Across the 15 states in the study area, the borer was associated with an additional 6113 deaths related to illness of the lower respiratory system, and 15,080 cardiovascular-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that loss of trees to the emerald ash borer increased mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory-tract illness. This finding adds to the growing evidence that the natural environment provides major public health benefits.},

abstract = {Devising effective management strategies to relieve dependency on private vehicles, i.e. cars and motorcycles, depends on the ability to accurately and carefully examine the effects of corresponding strategies. Disaggregate choice models regarding the ownership, type and usage of cars and motorcycles are required to achieve this. Consequently, this study proposes integrated car and motorcycle models based on a large-scale questionnaire survey of Taiwanese owners of cars and motorcycles, respectively. Incorporating gas mile-age and emission coefficients for different types of cars and motorcycles into the proposed models can enable the estimation and comparison of reductions in energy consumption and emissions under various management strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed integrated models, scenarios involving 10{\%} and 30{\%} increases in gas prices are analyzed and compared. The results indicate that gas price elasticities of cars and motorcycles are low, ranging from 0.47 to 0.50 for cars and 0.11 for motorcycles. Addition-ally, a high ratio of discouraged car users shifting to use of motorcycles neutralizes the effects of increased gas price in reducing energy consumption and emissions. Pollution of CO and HC even slightly increased because motorcycles are much more polluting in terms of CO and HC. At last, the reductions of energy consumption and emissions under 10{\%} and 30{\%} increase (or decrease) in other manipulating variables are also estimated and compared. The countermeasures for reducing ownership and usage of cars and motor-cycles are then recommended accordingly.},

So far, mainly Lagrange Multiplier tests based on ordinary least squares residuals are employed to decide whether and in which form spatial correlation is present in Cliff-Ord type spatial models. In this paper, the model selection is based both on likelihood ratio and Wald tests using estimates for the general model and information criteria. The results of the conducted large Monte Carlo study suggest that Wald tests on the spatial parameters after estimation of the general model are the most reliable approach to reveal the nature of spatial correlation.},

Results indicate that the presence of trees and grass is related to the use of outdoor spaces, the amount of social activity that takes place within them, and the proportion of social to nonsocial activities they support. The findings improve and broaden our understanding of the physical characteristics that influence social contact among neighbors and provide evidence that nature plays an important role in creating vital neighborhood spaces.},

Recent decades illustrate a rapid increase of the application of big data approaches in transportation, bringing new opportunities for innovation in transport modeling. This article analyzes the theories and methods of big data in traffic demand forecasting. In view of theory, the new models and algorithms are proposed in order to adapt to new big data and response to the limitations of traditional disaggregated approaches. In such approaches, three traffic demand-forecasting methods, the full sample-demand distribution model, the traffic integration model, the model organism protein expression database model, are discussed. Undoubtedly, the development of big data also presents new challenges to travel-demand forecasting methods regarding data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, and application of results. In particular, identifying how to improve approaches to traffic-demand forecasting in the big data era in the Third World will be a challenge to the researchers in the field.},

@article{Heldt2018,
abstract = {Modeling residential location as a key component of the land-use system is essential to understand the relationship between land use and transport. The increasing availability of censuses such as the German Zensus 2011 has enabled residential location to be modeled with a large number of observations, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Censuses are statistically highly representative; however, they often lack variables such as income or mobility-related attributes as in the case of Zensus 2011. This is particularly problematic if missing variables define utility or willingness-to-pay functions that characterize choice options in a location model. One example for this is household income, which is an indispensable variable in land use models because it influences household location preferences and defines affordable location options. For estimating bid-auction location models for different income groups, we impute household income in census data applying an ordered regression model. We find that location models considering this imputation perform sufficiently well as they reveal reasonable and expected aspects of the location patterns. In general, imputing choice variables should thus be considered in the estimation of residential location models but is also promising for other decision problems. Comparing results for two imputation methods, we also show that while applying the deterministic first preference imputation may yield misleading results the probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation is the correct imputation approach.},

@techreport{Sprawl2014,
abstract = {Some places in the United States are sprawling out and some places are building in compact, connected ways. The difference between these two strategies affects the lives of millions of Americans. In 2002, Smart Growth America released Measuring Sprawl and Its Impact, a landmark study that has been widely used by researchers to examine the costs and benefits of sprawling development. In peer-reviewed research, sprawl has been linked to physical inactivity, obesity, traffic fatalities, poor air quality, residential energy use, emergency response times, teenage driving, lack of social capital and private-vehicle commute distances and times. Measuring Sprawl 2014 updates that research and analyzes development patterns in 221 metropolitan areas and 994 counties in the United States as of 2010, looking to see which communities are more compact and connected and which are more sprawling. Researchers used four primary factors—residential and employment density; neighborhood mix of homes, jobs and services; strength of activity centers and downtowns; and accessibility of the street network—to evaluate development in these areas and assign a Sprawl Index score to each. This report includes a list of the most compact and most sprawling metro areas in the country. This report also examines how Sprawl Index scores relate to life in that community. The researchers found that several quality of life factors improve as index scores rise. Individuals in compact, connected metro areas have greater economic mobility. Individuals in these areas spend less on the combined cost of housing and transportation, and have greater options for the type of transportation to take. In addition, individuals in compact, connected metro areas tend to live longer, safer, healthier lives than their peers in metro areas with sprawl. Obesity is less prevalent in compact counties, and fatal car crashes are less common. Finally, this report includes specific examples of how communities are building to be more connected and walkable, and how policymakers at all levels of government can support their efforts.},

Results indicate that frequent travelers and those purchasing from Delta versus AirTran are more likely to request ticketing changes. Other factors influencing cancellation behavior include the time from ticket purchase, time before flight departure, and whether the itinerary is for the outbound or inbound portion of a trip.},

Visitors (n=8608) responded on a five-point Likert scale to 23 predictor items grouped into five categories. Item correlations revealed numerous strong predictors. Multiple regression analyses revealed that 34{\%} of visitor satisfaction variance was predicted by ratings in just two categories of items: park maintenance and park personnel. Park managers who concentrate their efforts on these two manageable and demonstrably important features of the park experience-by assuring maintenance and cleanliness of the park and by training employees and their behaviors-should produce measurable and documentable increases in park visitor satisfaction. The authors suggest that cooperative planning and good communication between park managers and university researchers can greatly improve the quality and usefulness of research.},

It focuses on households who relocate within the Central Puget Sound region to determine if they change their travel behavior when they move from one neighborhood type to another. Regression models are used to predict change in travel behavior as a function of change in neighborhood accessibility, controlling for changes in life cycle, regional accessibility, and workplace accessibility. The study is unique in that it analyzes the travel behavior of the same households in a longitudinal manner in concert with detailed urban form measures. The findings suggest that households change travel behavior when exposed to differing urban forms. In particular, locating to areas with higher neighborhood accessibility decreases vehicle miles traveled.},

The results are quite different: very concentrated effects in the daily accessibility indicator, less concentrated in the economic potential one and more dispersal in the location indicator. The sign (polarizing/balancing) of these effects depend on the geographic scale: polarizing effects at the national level and balancing effects at both corridor and European levels are identified.

While accessibility represents an important 4 regional-scale factor, more local influences such as proximity to urban highway links may 5 also positively or negatively influence the desirability of a location. In this paper, we use a 6 cross-section of home sales in Hennepin County, Minnesota from the years 2001 through 2004, 7 along with a set of disaggregate regional accessibility measures, to estimate the value of access 8 to employment and resident workers. We also estimate the (dis)amenity effects of locations 9 near major freeway links that have recently undergone, or were scheduled to undergo (as of the 10 time period covered by the home sales), major construction to add capacity. The richness of the 11 home sales data set allows us to control for a number of structural attributes, as well as some 12 site characteristics, while additional neighborhood characteristics (such as income levels and 13 local educational quality) are added from supplemental data sources. Empirical results indicate 14 that households highly value employment access, while access to other resident workers (i.e. 15 competition for jobs) is considered a disamenity. Proximity to local highway access points is 16 positively associated with sale price, while proximity to the highway link itself is negatively 17 associated with price. The paper concludes with some implications for research and practice of 18 the concept and measurement of the relationship between location and land value.},

Studies investigating the relationship between house price and changes in accessibility, however, have been fewer in number, and predominantly have centered upon the house price impact of fixed rail investments. Neglected have been the impacts of smaller road investments made on a regular basis by municipalities and state departments of transportation. This research therefore reports on the spatial relationship between house price and investment in road-based transportation infrastructure by combining two spatial databases, both cen- tered on Columbus, OH. The first contains information on all single-family detached houses sold in 1990. The second contains detailed spatial and temporal information on all accessibility-changing road investments in the same area, since 1978. Results indicate that while moderate, past, current and approved (but not begun) road investments have distinct and significant impacts on house price.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Park-based physical activity is a promising means to satisfy current physical activity requirements. However, there is little research concerning what park environmental and policy characteristics might enhance physical activity levels. This study proposes a conceptual model to guide thinking and suggest hypotheses. This framework describes the relationships between park benefits, park use, and physical activity, and the antecedents/correlates of park use. In this classification scheme, the discussion focuses on park environmental characteristics that could be related to physical activity, including park features, condition, access, aesthetics, safety, and policies. Data for these categories should be collected within specific geographic areas in or around the park, including activity areas, supporting areas, the overall park, and the surrounding neighborhood. Future research should focus on how to operationalize specific measures and methodologies for collecting data, as well as measuring associations between individual physical activity levels and specific park characteristics. Collaboration among many disciplines is needed.},

abstract = {The decrease in travel times, the better quality of the supplied services and the improved accessibility are the main factors of success of High Speed Rail links. In this paper, evidence of the impacts of the High Speed Rail line between Rome and Naples in Italy will be provided on the basis of a survey which was carried out in March 2008. A Revealed Preference (RP) survey was undertaken by Trenitalia (the Commercial Division of Italian railways) and three different questionnaires were prepared to be submitted to car users, Intercity train users and High Speed train users. They all have in common questions concerning the socioeconomic characteristics of the users, questions related to the existence of possible time constraints for the trip undertaken and questions concerning previous travel choices. Data from Trenitalia highlighted that the use of car and of Intercity trains had almost remained unchanged during the few years of operation of the High Speed service. However, a generated demand was derived from the use of this High Speed Rail link and this means that the introduction of the High Speed service between Rome and Naples probably had impacts, as excepted, on mobility choices (i.e. increase in trip frequency, new trips never done before, etc.). Data gathered were used first of all to understand this phenomenon and then to estimate a mode choice model to reproduce/forecast modal share. Specifically the choice between car and rail was modelled through a schedule based approach and with a Nested Logit model with the “train” utility function including late and early penalties.},

abstract = {The link between the built environment and human behavior has long been of interest to the field of urban planning, but direct assessments of the links between the built environment and physical activity as it influences personal health are still rare in the field. Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior.},

abstract = {One strategy for increasing physical activity is to create and enhance access to park space. We assessed the literature on the relationship of parks and objectively measured physical activity in population-based studies in the United States (US) and identified limitations in current built environment and physical activity measurement and reporting. Five English-language scholarly databases were queried using standardized search terms. Abstracts were screened for the following inclusion criteria: 1) published between January 1990 and June 2013; 2) US-based with a sample size greater than 100 individuals; 3) included built environment measures related to parks or trails; and 4) included objectively measured physical activity as an outcome. Following initial screening for inclusion by two independent raters, articles were abstracted into a database. Of 10,949 abstracts screened, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. Five articles reported a significant positive association between parks and physical activity. Nine studies found no association, and six studies had mixed findings. Our review found that even among studies with objectively measured physical activity, the association between access to parks and physical activity varied between studies, possibly due to heterogeneity of exposure measurement. Self-reported (vs. independently-measured) neighborhood park environment characteristics and smaller (vs. larger) buffer sizes were more predictive of physical activity. We recommend strategies for further research, employing standardized reporting and innovative study designs to better understand the relationship of parks and physical activity.},

abstract = {Auto ownership is a critical mediating link in the connection between the built environment and travel behavior: the built environment presumably influences auto ownership, which in turn impacts travel behavior. However, the way in which individual elements of the built environment affect auto-ownership choices is far from understood. Further, residential self-selection may confound the interaction between the built environment and auto ownership. And the absence of panel data impedes our understanding of the causal relationships. Using a survey of 1682 respondents in Northern California, we applied ordered probit and static-score modeling techniques to investigate the causal link from the built environment to auto ownership in both cross-sectional and quasi-panel contexts. Through variable selection in cross-sectional analysis, we found that individuals' attitudes regarding residential neighborhood and travel are more strongly associated with their auto-ownership decision than is the built environment per se. Specifically, when general preferences for various neighborhood traits were allowed to enter the model, they drove out from the model the (perceived) measure of the same trait for the neighborhood of current residence, a pattern suggesting that the observed correla- tion between neighborhood characteristics and auto ownership is primarily a result of self-selection. On the other hand, the quasi-panel results indicate that some built-environment elements such as outdoor spaciousness and mixed land use are causes of auto ownership (remaining even after attitudes were allowed to enter the model), but their effects are marginal. In contrast, the strong influence of sociodemographics suggests that households' auto-ownership decisions are fundamentally based on their mobility needs and purchasing power. Given the mixed findings, we do not definitively confirm a causal relationship between the built environment and auto ownership. However, we provide encour- aging evidence that land-use policies designed to reduce auto ownership and use will lead to a marginal reduction in auto ownership.},

Cao et al. used quasi-panel data collected from a survey to evaluate the effects of attitudinal and built-environment characteristics on automobile ownership. The data are collected by mail-back surveys, using a residential advertising list as the sampling frame. The sampling strategy explicity separated traditional neighborhoods from suburban developments, and movers from non-movers. Respondents were asked questions regarding neighborhood characteristics, neighborhood preference, travel attitude, and sociodemographics. Scores are created for characteristics, preferences, and attitudes. The auto ownership of movers is also modeled with a static score model.




The authors report two ordered probit models on the cross-sectional data: one excluding travel attitudes and neighborhood preferences, and the other including them. Including attitudes and preferences significantly improves the model prediction, and also renders stated neighborhood characteristics immaterial. 




The simplifying reasons for reducing the survey responses to attribute scores are obvious, but I worry that information may be lost in the conversion. I am not familiar with the pattern matrix used to normalize these things (if that is in fact what it does), it nevertheless seems that the questions should have been incorporated into some model directly. The fact that stated preference variables supersede revealed preference variables in the model is similarly puzzling, but this could be simply a fact of individuals remaining unsatisfied with their current environments. 




The main contribution of this paper is that it quantifies the effect of residential self-selection bias, and yet leaves open the possibility for causal relationships between the built environment of a residential location and auto ownership.},

They use a multinomial probit model to predict concurrently the level of auto ownership and whether a household locates in the central city or in the suburbs. The authors then demonstrate the marginal effects of including variables that represent the previous household location, and conclude that this measurement of learned preference is significant.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}

This is dismissed as irrelevant, and I tend to agree. The principal weakness I see in this study is the use of the 2000 Census rather than the American Community Survey. The ACS five-year sample would allow for a much finer geographic resolution, not to mention more updated information. I have sent Dr. Weinberger an email asking her why they did not use the ACS.{\textless}m:linebreak{\textgreater}{\textless}/m:linebreak{\textgreater}

With Equifax, we will be able to not only map to previous location, but include factors such as how long an individual lived in a transit-available metropolis. In the Census, we only know the previous location, not the duration of that stay. If their theory is correct, we could assume that someone who lived in San Francisco for ten years would exhibit even stronger preferences than someone who had only lived there for one year.

Therefore, in this research, a computer simulation study of motor vehicles and pedestrians at right-turn lanes was conducted to determine their operational effects. A benefit-cost analysis of right-turn lanes that considered both their operational and safety effects was performed. The research indicates that right-turn maneuvers from a two-lane arterial at an unsignalized intersection or driveway can delay through traffic by 0 to 6 s per through vehicle where no right-turn lane is present. Delays to through traffic due to right turns in the same situation on a four-lane arterial are substantially lower, in the range from 0 to 1 s per through vehicle. Pedestrians at unsignalized intersections or driveways can have a substantial impact on delay to through vehicles due to slowing of right-turning vehicles yielding to pedestrians. Provision of a right-turn lane can reduce pedestrian-related delays to through traffic by as much as 6 s per through vehicle, depending on pedestrian volume. Also presented is an economic-analysis procedure that can identify unsignalized intersections and major driveways at which provision of right-turn lanes is cost-effective.},

abstract = {AbstractThe original main aim of high-speed rail (HSR) was to link big metropolitan areas 400–600 km apart. Recently, intermediate HSR stations have also been created in suburban areas or small cities within the limits of metropolitan areas (up to 100 km), opening up new metropolitan transportation opportunities, notably the strengthening of inward and outward commuting and through traffic across the metropolis. The argument advanced in this paper is under what conditions HSR could facilitate the development of small HSR suburban cities as special subcenters of the metropolitan area with particularly good connections to the metropolitan center and to other distant metropolises. The paper focuses on a comparative study of this new type of metropolitan HSR by analyzing the Madrid (Toledo, Segovia, and Guadalajara stations), Spain, and the London (Ashford, Ebbsfleet, and Stratford stations) cases. Infrastructure layout, station typologies, and rail services are compared together with each city's territorial ...},

abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, the airline industry has seen volatile fuel prices, a record number of carriers ending service, and a merger between two major airlines. In a time of such turmoil in the industry, it is increasingly important to understand the relationship between airline consolidation and competitive pricing policies, because this relationship directly affects the formation of new airline policies associated with competition policy (antitrust), deregulation, and mergers. However, there is a lack of consensus about market concentration and its influence on airfares, mainly because of data limitations of past research. Given the emergence of online booking engines, there is a new opportunity to collect detailed fare data. This project uses disaggregate online airfare data to study the relationship between market concentration and pricing policies. The data set includes 62 markets that cover a broad range of market structures. A case study approach is used to analyze the data. Using disaggregate fare data, this study finds low price dispersion can be associated with both low and high levels of market concentration. As the day of departure approaches, price dispersion is observed to increase or decrease, depending on the market. Additionally, peak and off-peak periods demonstrate different pricing strategies. Markets with codeshares sometimes exhibit unusually high price dispersion.},

abstract = {This paper presents housing price models by using multilevel modeling techniques. The key motivation of using the multilevel modeling technique is that it clearly identifies and differentiates between-cluster heterogeneity (i.e., intrinsic differences across aggregated units) and heterogeneity between units of analysis that are nested within aggregated clusters. Two different specifications are tested: two-level spatial and mixed two-level spatiotemporal random effects models. Whereas the first specification assumes that dwelling units are nested within spatial clusters (i.e., neighborhoods), the second specification hypothesizes that dwelling units are nested within spatiotemporal clusters (neighborhoods in a given time period). The unique contribution of this paper is that it accounts for temporal heterogeneity simultaneously with spatial heterogeneity in the housing price models. The study uses an extensive sample of more than 250,000 housing property transactions in 1987-1995 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada. The paper examines the functional form of the hedonic price model and chooses a semilogarithmic model for subsequent multilevel housing price modeling. The results suggest that the spatiotemporal model performs better in terms of explanatory power and parameter estimates.},

abstract = {The structure of transportation networks and the patterns of accessibility they give rise to are an important determinant of land prices, and hence urban spatial structure. While there is ample evidence on the cross-sectional relationship between location and land value (usually measured from the value of improved property), there is much less evidence available on the changes in this relationship over time, especially where location is represented using a disaggregate mea- sure of urban accessibility. This paper provides evidence of this dynamic relationship using data on home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MN) metropolitan area, coupled with disag- gregate measures of urban accessibility for multiple modes, for the period from 2000 to 2005. Our investigation seeks to track the effects of marginal changes in accessibility over time, as opposed to static, cross-sectional relationships, by using an unconventional approach in which the unit of observation is a “representative house” for each transportation analysis zone in the region. This approach allows us to control for changes in structural attributes of houses over time, while also isolating the effect of changes in accessibility levels. Results of this approach are compared to a cross-sectional model using the same variables for a single year to illustrate important differences. These differences are discussed in terms of their implications for prac- titioners and for further investigations of the relationship between transportation, location and land value.},

Studies investi- gating the relationship between house price and changes in accessibility, however, have been fewer in number, and predominantly have centered upon the house price impact of fixed rail investments. Neglected have been the impacts of smaller road investments made on a regular basis by municipalities and state departments of transportation. This research therefore reports on the spatial relationship between house price and investment in road-based transportation infrastructure by combining two spatial databases, both cen- tered on Columbus, OH. The first contains information on all single-family detached houses sold in 1990. The second contains detailed spatial and temporal information on all accessibility-changing road investments in the same area, since 1978. Results indicate that while moderate, past, current and approved (but not begun) road investments have distinct and significant impacts on house price.},

abstract = {The structure of transportation networks and the patterns of accessibility they give rise to are an important determinant of land prices, and hence urban spatial structure. While there is ample evidence on the cross-sectional relationship between location and land value (usually measured from the value of improved property), there is much less evidence available on the changes in this relationship over time, especially where location is represented using a disaggregate mea- sure of urban accessibility. This paper provides evidence of this dynamic relationship using data on home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MN) metropolitan area, coupled with disag- gregate measures of urban accessibility for multiple modes, for the period from 2000 to 2005. Our investigation seeks to track the effects of marginal changes in accessibility over time, as opposed to static, cross-sectional relationships, by using an unconventional approach in which the unit of observation is a “representative house” for each transportation analysis zone in the region. This approach allows us to control for changes in structural attributes of houses over time, while also isolating the effect of changes in accessibility levels. Results of this approach are compared to a cross-sectional model using the same variables for a single year to illustrate important differences. These differences are discussed in terms of their implications for prac- titioners and for further investigations of the relationship between transportation, location and land value.},

abstract = {The impact of landmark designation on prices of the property and its neighbors sits at the core of the policy debate and empirical research on historic preservation. Yet these studies suffer from serious methodological limitations and biases. First, as important unobserved characteristics likely correlate with landmark designation, an omitted-variable bias results. Second, if designations depend on property values or neighborhood housing market conditions, the endogenous selection process further undermines inferences about preservation policies' effects. This article outlines more robust empirical strategies and presents new evidence on landmark designation effects on property values. For a sample of Chicago home sales during the 1990s, a hedonic price analysis suggests that landmark buildings and districts sell at a small premium. To address the omitted-variable bias, a repeat-sales approach demonstrates significant spillover effects of landmark designation on prices. These estimates are also robust to sample-selection bias and some forms of spatial autocorrelation.},

The former values features implying a natural or less intense use, and the latter values features adding “intensity or utility to a property” (8).

abstract = {This paper introduces a new joint vehicle transaction timing model in which household residential and job relocation timings are also incorporated. Furthermore, the household members' job relocation timing decision along with the influence of their decisions on each others' and also on the household residential relocation timing decision is modeled. In addition, the household residential relocation timing decision and its effect on the household members' job relocation decision is also studied. Some researchers have modeled the household vehicle ownership decision jointly with some other household decisions like vehicle type choice or vehicle miles traveled (VMT); however, these models were basically static and changes in household taste over time has been ignored in nearly all of these models. This paper presents a dynamic joint model in which the effect of land-use, economy and disaggregate travel activity attributes on three major interdependent household decisions are examined. A hazard-based simultaneous system of equations for work and residential relocation timing and vehicle transaction timing is formulated with two baseline hazard functions of Weibull and log-logistic. In order to estimate parameters of the simultaneous system of equations, the last three waves of the Puget Sound Panel Survey data and land-use, transportation, and built environment variables from the Seattle Metropolitan Area are utilized.},

abstract = {Identifying the attributes that households consider when making residential location decisions is central to land use and transportation planning and policy analysis. That different households have different tastes for these attributes is axiomatic; this research focuses on identifying and representing the differences. In discrete choice applications, including the analysis of residential location decisions and travel mode choice, taste variation can be addressed by segmenting the sample using indicators of household structure (age of household head, household size, and presence of children) and household sociodemographic variables (income, race, and gender) and by developing model specifications that allow taste weights for attributes to be influenced by household structure and sociodemographic variables. This research draws on multi-disciplinary residential location literature to identify potential sources of taste variation and employs various analytical techniques, including full and partial segmentation, to represent systematic variations in taste for housing, population, and accessibility attributes among households in the San Francisco, California, metropolitan area. This research addresses the two major deficiencies of most residential location choice model specifications, namely (1) the omission of important tract socioeconomic status, family suitability, and racial composition attributes from the utility function and (2) the omission of taste parameters that identify differences in taste for attributes for households with different characteristics. The analytical results suggest (1) that taste for work commute is influenced by household structure, commuter characteristics and, possibly, household race, (2) that the taste for tract racial composition is influences by household race, (3) that the taste for tract family suitability is influenced by household structure and, possibly, household race, (4) that taste for tract socioeconomic status is influenced by household income, household race, and, possibly, household structure, and (5) that taste for retail accessibility is possibly influenced by household structure and race.},

abstract = {This paper reviews and refutes three criticisms by Daly of earlier papers by Koppelman. and Wen (1998a. and b). The original papers identified important differences between two forms of the nested logit model. These differences between the Utility Maximizing Nested Logit (UMNL) and the Non-Normalized Nested Logit (NNNL) lead to important differences in model estimation, interpretation and prediction. We reaffirm the position that the NNNL model is not consistent with utility maximization unless normalized as recommended by Koppelman and Wen and challenge Daly's criticism of the earlier papers. First, Daly's hypothesis of the existence of an alternative behavioral theory, while correct in principle, is irrelevant to the question at hand, selection of a preferred model form, in the absence of an explicit theory. Second, the equivalence of the two models under special circumstances is consistent with Koppelman and Wen's recommendation for normalization of the NNNL model. Third, the argument that the NNNL has the advantage that it can estimate models which combine data from different sources is not correct as both model structures can estimate such models. Thus, we maintain the conclusion that the NNNL and UMNL models are distinct and the UMNL is preferred because of its consistency with established theories of behavior and social welfare.

abstract = {This study presents a joint model system of residential location and activity time-use choices that considers a comprehensive set of activity-travel environment (ATE) variables, as well as socio-demographic variables, as determinants of individual weekday activity time-use choices. The model system takes the form of a joint mixed Multinomial Logit–Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MNL–MDCEV) structure that (a) accommodates differential sensitivity to the ATE attributes due to both observed and unobserved individual-related attributes, and (b) controls for the self-selection of individuals into neighborhoods due to both observed and unobserved individual-related factors. The joint model system is estimated on a sample of 2793 households and individuals residing in Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area. The model results indicate the significant presence of residential self-selection effects due to both observed and unobserved individual-related factors. For instance, individuals from households with more bicycles are associated with a higher preference for out-of-home physically active pure recreational travel pursuits (such as bicycling around in the neighborhood). These same individuals locate into neighborhoods with good bicycling facilities. This leads to a non-causal association between individuals' time investment in out-of-home physically active pure recreational travel and bicycling facilities in their residential neighborhoods. Thus, ignoring the effect of bicycle ownership in the time-use model, would lead to an inflated estimate of the effect of bicycling facility density on the time invested in physically active pure recreational travel. Similarly, there are significant unobserved individual factors that lead to a high preference for physically active recreational activities and also make individuals locate in areas with good bicycling facilities. When such unobserved factors were controlled by the proposed joint residential location and time-use model, the impact of bicycling facility density on out-of-home physically active recreational activities ceased to be statistically significant (from being statistically significant in the independent time-use model). These results highlight the need to control for residential self-selection effects when estimating the effects of the activity-travel environment on activity time-use choices.},

Through a latent tree structure analysis, age, residential location, immigration stage, gender, personal income, and race are found to be the primary determinants in the workplace commute decision-making process. By defining several relatively homogeneous population segments, the likelihood of falling into each segment is found to differ across age groups and geography, with different indicators affecting each group differentially. This analysis complements past studies that used regression models to investigate socio-demographic indicators and their impact on travel behavior in two distinct ways: (a) analysis is done by considering travel time, mode choice, and departure time for work simultaneously, and (b) heterogeneity in behavior is accounted for using methods that identify different groups of behavior and then their determinants. Conclusively the method here is richer than many other methods used to study the ethnically diverse population of California and shows the addition of geographic location and latent segment identification to greatly improve our understanding of specific behaviors. It also provides evidence that immigrants are as diverse as the non-immigrant population and transportation policies need to be defined accordingly.},

abstract = {Residential mobility and relocation choice are essential parts of integrated transportation and land use models. These decision processes have been examined and modeled individually to a great extent but there remain gaps in the literature on the underlying behaviors that connect them. Households may partly base their decision to move from or stay at a current location on the price and quality of the available alternatives. Conversely, households that are on the market for a new location may evaluate housing choices relative to their previous residence. How and the degree to which these decisions relate to each other are, however, not completely understood. This research is intended to contribute to the body of empirical evidence that will help answer these questions. It is hypothesized that residential mobility and location choice are related household decisions that can be modeled together using a two-tier hierarchical structure. This paper presents a novel nested logit (NL) model with sampling of alternatives and a proposed procedure for sampling bias correction. The model was estimated using full-information maximum likelihood estimation methods. The results confirm the applicability of this NL model and support similar findings from other empirical studies in the residential mobility and location choice literature.},

A comparison of alternative model specifications illuminate the nature of purchase, recognizing location attributes as well as home size and cost. Sample data come from a survey of home buyers in Austin, Texas and parameter estimates support the notion that home type is an upper-nest decision, relative to location, with homes of similar type exhibiting more correlation in unobserved components than those within a single location. With a particular home type in mind, location choice may become constrained by home availability across locations of the urban area. Thus, a focus simply on residential location choice can lead to a misunderstanding of the home search and residential development process.},

abstract = {This paper presents housing price models by using multilevel modeling techniques. The key motivation of using the multilevel modeling technique is that it clearly identifies and differentiates between-cluster heterogeneity (i.e., intrinsic differences across aggregated units) and heterogeneity between units of analysis that are nested within aggregated clusters. Two different specifications are tested: two-level spatial and mixed two-level spatiotemporal random effects models. Whereas the first specification assumes that dwelling units are nested within spatial clusters (i.e., neighborhoods), the second specification hypothesizes that dwelling units are nested within spatiotemporal clusters (neighborhoods in a given time period). The unique contribution of this paper is that it accounts for temporal heterogeneity simultaneously with spatial heterogeneity in the housing price models. The study uses an extensive sample of more than 250,000 housing property transactions in 1987-1995 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada. The paper examines the functional form of the hedonic price model and chooses a semilogarithmic model for subsequent multilevel housing price modeling. The results suggest that the spatiotemporal model performs better in terms of explanatory power and parameter estimates.},

abstract = {Activity-based travel modeling has begun to make significant progress toward a more behavioral framework for simulating household travel behavior. A significant challenge remains in the need to address the interaction of daily activity and travel patterns with longer-term household choices of vehicle ownership, residential location, and employment location. The choices often depend on one another and jointly define the lifestyle of the household. These choices are likely to evolve over the course of the life cycle as households are formed; as children are born, raised, and ultimately depart to form their own households; and as retirement and old age change patterns of residence, work, and travel. A framework is developed for analyzing household choices relating to three dimensions of lifestyle: travel patterns (including vehicle ownership), activity participation, and residential location (neighborhood type). With cluster analysis on data from the Puget Sound Transportation Panel, nine classifications of lifestyle are uncovered. These clusters demonstrate empirically how decisions of residential location reinforce and affect daily decisions related to travel patterns and activity participation. The applicability of these lifestyle clusters for land use transportation planning is discussed.},

As an alternative to panel studies, a retrospective interviewing technique to collect data for use in a dynamic model of residential mobility is examined. A small retrospective survey of households in Toronto, Canada, was conducted using three data collection methods; mail, telephone, and telephone with mail. Ninety complete observations were obtained. The retrospective survey process and the three data collection methods are assessed and evaluated. Though not without problems, the retrospective survey proved to be a favorable alternative to panel studies.

In this paper, we introduce a maximum approximated composite marginal likelihood (MACML) estimation approach that can be applied using simple optimization software for likelihood estimation. It also represents a conceptually and pedagogically simpler simulation-free procedure relative to simulation techniques, and has the advantage of reproducibility of the results and substantial computational efficiency relative to the MSL approach.

abstract = {This paper contributes to the growing literature that identiﬁes and measures the impact of social context on individual economic behavior. We develop a model of housing demand with neighborhood eﬀects and neighborhood choice. Modelling neighborhood choice is of fundamental importance in estimating and understanding endogenous and exogenous neighborhood eﬀects. That is, to obtain unbiased estimates of neighborhood eﬀects, it is necessary to control for non-random sorting into neighborhoods. Estimation of the model exploits a unique data set of household data that has been augmented with contextual information at two diﬀerent levels (“scales”) of aggregation. One is at the neighborhood cluster level, of about ten neighbors, with the data coming from a special sample of the American Housing Survey. A second level is the census tract to which these dwelling units belong. Tract-level data are available in the Summary Tape Files of the decennial Census data. We merge these two data sets by gaining access to conﬁdential data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Our results for the neighborhood choice model indicate that individuals prefer to live near others like themselves. Our estimates of the housing demand equation do conﬁrm that neighborhood eﬀects are important. Neighborhood choice appears to be associated with the following diﬀerences, when it is accounted for relative to when it is not, as in earlier work. First, there is a smaller endogenous social eﬀect: the elasticity of housing demand with respect to mean neighbors' demand is 0.6244 instead of 0.660 in earlier work. Second, there is a larger contextual eﬀect: the elasticity of housing demand with respect to mean neighbors' income is 0.2600 instead of 0.175.},

abstract = {This paper presents a modeling methodology capable of accounting for spatial correlation across choice alternatives in discrete choice modeling applications. Many location choice (e.g., residential location, workplace location, destination location) modeling contexts involve choice sets where alternatives are spatially correlated with one another. In the presence of spatial correlation, traditional discrete choice modeling methods that are often based on the assumption of independence among choice alternatives are not appropriate. Previous work in the field has yielded methods that can accommodate correlation among neighboring or adjacent location choices, but has not provided the ability to accommodate spatial correlations that may exist across choice alternatives that are not necessarily neighbors or adjoining one another. In this paper, a generalized spatially correlated logit (GSCL) model, and its mixed version, that allows one to represent the degree of spatial correlation as a function of a multidimensional vector of attributes characterizing each pair of location choice alternatives is formulated and presented. The model is applied to the analysis of residential location choice behavior using a sample of households drawn from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) data set. Model estimation results obtained from the GSCL are compared against those obtained using the standard multinomial logit (MNL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model where only correlations across neighboring (or adjacent) alternatives are accommodated. Model findings suggest that there is significant spatial correlation across alternatives that do not share a common boundary, and that the GSCL offers the ability to more accurately capture spatial location choice behavior.},

Using a multinomial probit model, the paper demonstrates that residents in the US transit cities who moved from major metropolitan areas are more likely to own fewer vehicles than counterparts who moved from smaller metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas. It is concluded that these results are due to learned preferences for levels of car ownership.

Furthermore, our access to individual-level data with census tract identifiers allows us to separately identify recent in-migrants and long-term residents. Our results indicate that, on average, the demographic flows associated with the gentrification of urban neighborhoods during the 1990's are not consistent with displacement and harm to minority households. In fact, taken as a whole, our results suggest that gentrification of predominantly black neighborhoods creates neighborhoods that are attractive to middle-class black households.},

Some studies, such as Ellen and O'Regan (2008) and Bostic and Martin (2003), use aggregate data to identify and describe gentrifying tracts. These studies, however, are unable to examine the process of gentriﬁcation, because they lack the data to distinguish in-migrants, out-migrants and long-term residents. Most of the available micro-data sets that do allow analysis of ﬂows into or out of gentrifying neighborhoods typically identify neighborhoods that are unsatisfactorily large in size or only cover an individual city. Our use of conﬁdential Census Long Form data allows us to circumvent these data issues as we have a very large, nationally representative sample of individual-level data with census tract identiﬁers" (181).

In contrast, the conﬁdential Long Form data identify census tracts that, as described above, contain an average of 4000 individuals. There are also public Census data sets that report aggregate census tract-level characteristics, but they do not disaggregate by key variables such as the migration status of the household" (182).},

I also combine the multivariate ordered equations with Tobit equations to jointly estimate vehicle type/usage demand in a reduced form, offering a simpler alternative to the traditional discrete/continuous analysis. Using the 2001 National Household Travel Survey data, I find that increasing residential density reduces households' truck holdings and utilization in a statistically significant but economically insignificant way. The results are broadly consistent with those from a model derived from random utility maximization. The method developed above can be applied to other discrete–continuous problems.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the ability of the maximum approximated composite marginal likelihood (MACML) estimation approach to recover parameters from finite samples in mixed cross- sectional and panel multinomial probit models. Comparisons with the maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) estimation approach are also undertaken. The results indicate that the MACML approach recovers parameters much more accurately than the MSL approach in all model structures and covariance specifications. The MACML inference approach also estimates the parameters efficiently, with the asymptotic standard errors being, in general, only a small proportion of the true values. As importantly, the MACML inference approach takes only a very small fraction of the time needed for MSL estimation. In particular, the results suggest that, for the case of five random coefficients, the MACML approach is about 50 times faster than the MSL for the cross-sectional random coefficients case, about 15 times faster than the MSL for the panel inter-individual random coefficients case, and about 350 times or more faster than the MSL for the panel intra- and inter-individual random coefficients case. As the number of alternatives in the unordered-response model increases, one can expect even higher computational efficiency factors for the MACML over the MSL approach. Further, as should be evident in the panel intra- and inter-individual random coefficients case, the MSL is all but practically infeasible when the mixing structure leads to an explosion in the dimensionality of integration in the likelihood function, but these situations are handled with ease in the MACML approach. It is hoped that the MACML procedure will spawn empirical research into rich model specifications within the context of unordered multinomial choice modeling, including autoregressive random coefficients, dynamics in coefficients, space-time effects, and spatial/social interactions.},

abstract = {The literature for residential location choice is deficient in two aspects. First, many studies model location choice as a static choice, with no memory of the past. Second, current understanding of household trade-offs between attributes is limited. These two issues are addressed by developing and estimating a residential location model that accounts for prior locations by using the Puget Sound Panel (1989-2002) data set. Four types of accessibility attributes are examined: work, open space, retail opportunity, and recreation. A comparison between the proposed model and the existing literature model demonstrates the superiority of the former. Prior commute distance, open space, and recreation opportunity are all shown to influence current residential location choices.},

abstract = {In recent years, transportation researchers have turned to microsimulation models in order to capture and forecast patterns of land use and transport demand across urban networks. Although they bring with them many advantages, microsimulation models require rich micro-data sets as input. In response to this demand, and due to the difficulty of obtaining disaggregate data in practice, methods of population synthesis are employed, which create disaggregate population lists based on publicly available attribute tabulations and micro-samples. A further challenge arises when microsimulation models require that hierarchical relationships exist between different populations in a given study area. For instance, in microsimulation models of residential mobility a ‘comprehensive' population may be required, where individuals belong to households, which in turn belong to dwellings located in space. It is to such a situation that the authors focus their efforts in this paper, based on the requirements of a specific microsimulation model of residential mobility. Following a brief discussion of the problem in general terms, the authors devise and implement an algorithm in order to create linkages between populations of individuals and households for the City of Hamilton, Ontario. For this task, software is developed in the Python language, using a generic approach that allows for its use in other similar situations. Finally, the authors report on some validation results of the linked ‘comprehensive' population.},

abstract = {In the development of residential location choice models, multicollinearity among measures of socioeconomic status and family status prohibits the inclusion of a large number of these attributes in a single specification. Alternative methods of representing these attributes with a smaller number of summary or representative measures are tested. Factor analysis is performed on the census tract-level family status and socioeconomic status variables to produce factor scores that are used in residential location choice models. The factor analysis results are also used to select one representative socioeconomic status variable and one representative family status variable to be used in choice models. These approaches are tested against a base model that uses a full set of 11 attributes. To incorporate systematic taste variation, the factors and representative variables are interacted with individual household income and life-cycle characteristics. The factor analysis approach provides a clearer interpretation of the influence of socioeconomic status and family status than inclusion of multiple variables, which obtains many nonsignificant and counterintuitive parameters. The factor scores are preferred over the use of a single representative variable, which is not readily interpreted with respect to impact of the variables it represents.},

This analysis indicates that smart growth tends to benefit consumers in numerous ways. Market research indicates that most households want improved accessibility (indicated by shorter commutes), land use mix (indicated by nearby shops and services), and diverse transport options (indicated by good walking conditions and public transit services) and will often choose small-lot and attached homes with these features. Demographic and economic trends are increasing smart growth demand, causing a shortage of such housing. Demand for sprawl housing is declining, resulting in oversupply and reduced value. The current stock of large-lot housing is adequate for the foreseeable future, but the supply of small-lot and attached housing will need to approximately double by 2025 to meet growing demand.},

abstract = {Empirical studies on household car ownership have used two types of discrete choice modeling structures: ordered and unordered. In ordered response structures, such as the ordered logit and ordered probit models, the choice of the number of household vehicles arises from a unidimensional latent variable that reflects the propensity of a household to own vehicles. Unordered response structures are based on the random utility maximization principle, which assumes a household associates a utility value across different car ownership levels and chooses the one with the maximum utility. The most common unordered response models are the multinomial logit and probit models, but only the multinomial logit has been used in practical applications because of its simple structure and low computational requirements. Consensus among researchers on unordered or ordered structures is still lacking. Empirical studies have reported various models, including the multinomial logit, ordered logit, and ordered probit. An open question remains: Which model would better reflect households' car ownership choices? This paper compares multinomial logit, ordered logit, and ordered probit car ownership models through a number of formal evaluation measures and empirical analysis of three data sets: the 2001 National Household Travel Survey for the Baltimore [Maryland] Metropolitan Area, the 2005 Dutch National Travel Survey, and the 2000 Osaka [Japan] Metropolitan Person Trip Data. Results show the multinomial logit model should be selected for modeling the level of household car ownership.},

However, little empirical evidence about the relationships between e-shopping and in-store shopping is available. The aim of this study is to describe how the frequencies of online searching, online buying, and non-daily shopping trips relate to each other, and how they are influenced by such factors as attitudes, behaviour, and land use features. Questionnaire data were collected from 826 respondents residing in four municipalities (one urban, three suburban) in the centre of the Netherlands. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the variables' multiple and complex relationships. The results show that searching online positively affects the frequency of shopping trips, which in its turn positively influences buying online. An indirect positive effect of time-pressure on online buying was found and an indirect negative effect of online searching on shopping duration. These findings suggest that, for some people, e-shopping could be task-oriented (a time-saving strategy), and leisure-oriented for others. Urban residents shop online more often than suburban residents, because they tend to have a faster Internet connection. The more shopping opportunities one can reach within 10 min by bicycle, the less often one searches online.},

Models of land use dynamics need to consider residential relocation or mobility behavior of households to be able to forecast future population demographics land use patterns critical to activity and travel demand forecasting. Unfortunately, very little is known about residential relocation behavior at the disaggregate level, both in terms of the reasons for relocation and in terms of the duration of stay at a given residential location. This paper aims to fill this gap in knowledge by formulating and estimating a joint model of the reason for residential relocation and the duration of stay at a location. The model is estimated on a data set derived from a survey conducted in Zurich, Switzerland that captures information about residential moves over a 20 year period spanning 1985-2004. The paper provides elasticity estimates demonstrating how the model can be applied to evaluate impacts of changes in exogenous factors on residential mobility events.},

abstract = {Residential mobility and relocation choice are essential parts of integrated transportation and land use models. These decision processes have been examined and modeled individually to a great extent but there remain gaps in the literature on the underlying behaviors that connect them. Households may partly base their decision to move from or stay at a current location on the price and quality of the available alternatives. Conversely, households that are on the market for a new location may evaluate housing choices relative to their previous residence. How and the degree to which these decisions relate to each other are, however, not completely understood. This research is intended to contribute to the body of empirical evidence that will help answer these questions. It is hypothesized that residential mobility and location choice are related household decisions that can be modeled together using a two-tier hierarchical structure. This paper presents a novel nested logit (NL) model with sampling of alternatives and a proposed procedure for sampling bias correction. The model was estimated using fullinformation maximum likelihood estimation methods. The results confirm the applicability of this NL model and support similar findings from other empirical studies in the residential mobility and location choice literature.},

This economic effort is seldom set off, which leads to subsidies with the money collected from public debt growth or tax pressure increases. The question that immediately emerges is whether the entrance of this new infrastructure generates economic spillovers at the local level and, consequently, improves local public budgets. To solve this question we use local data on economic activity, municipalities׳ characteristics and local financial data in Spain for the past decade (2001–2010). Our estimations by difference-in-difference analysis and using spatial data yield a general conclusion: when HSR comes to town, both local revenues and the local fiscal gap improve by mean 10{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively. These improvements primarily affect municipalities located within 5km of an HSR station.},

What type of policies to implement and how effective they might be
Objectives - identify the current state of knowledge concerning the transportation-land-use interaction, identify gaps in our understanding (areas we are unsure of the direction of policy impacts), provide a discussion of the implications of these findings for the development and application of integrated transportation-land-use models 
Zupan (1977) developed 'land use threshold' that were necessary to justify financially different types of transit investments, based on intermodal compatisons of transit unit costs and intercity comparisons of transit trip generation rates. 
Land use characteristics that were identified to be determinants of transit demand were - size of downtown (measured by non-residential floor space, the distance of a site in the downtown and residential densities) 
Assumes a monocentric city - all work trips being to the central business district
Multi-centered city - trips to various nodes throughout the city 
Usage influenced very significantly by residential density
Developed models for VMT per household, non-work home-based VMT per household, auto ownership and mode choice
Schimek (1995) compared public transit use in Toronto to that in Boston with the ojective of indentifying factors that would account for the differences in patronage levels. 
Built environment influences the choice between the rail-access modes of walking and driving. Residents in dense, mixed-use residential neighbourhoods were found to be more likely to use walk as the acces mode to transit, while residents of low-density suburban areas use cars. Use of bus was influenced strongly by transit service levels and parkign supply and much less by densities and land-use mix. 
Evidence from studies of transit impacts on urban form have been mixed, some concluding transit to have a major impact under the 'right' conditions, while others have concluded that it has far less impact. 
Knight and Trygg (1977) examined land-use impacts of rapid transit in several North American cities. Toronto one of the few in which transit has done relatively well. Significant urban development is reported by the authors to have taken place in the lands adjacent to the rapid transit corridor during the period of the transit system staged development. 
Heenan (1966, 1968) his papers on the impact rapid transit had on land values in Toronto, claimed that the subway was responsible for igniting {\$}10 billion in development along its route, and also for two-thirds of the appreciation in the physical value of lands and facilities in Toronto during a 10-year period. 
Meyer and Gomez-Ibanex (1981) - concluded that the subway had much less impact in the city of Toronto. 
Knight and Trygg (1977) also found Heenan's findings of the Toronto rapid transit impact on land-use to be considerably overstated. 
Knight and Trygg - after examining the Toronto case more closely concluded that it was quite unique, in that zoning was closely coordinated with the rail lines, a coordination that has not been common for new transit facilities in the US. In short, that transit, in and of itself, is unlikely to have chalked up the relative success seen in Toronto, without the complement of urban policies to ensure this. 
Overall finding on land-use and transportation studies are mixed.

@article{Cervero1997,
annote = {This article looks at the land use impacts of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system roughly twenty years after its completions. Many studies had been conducted roughly 3-5 years following construction and argued that the BART system had minimal impacts on the land development outside the centre city, but this article looks at the situation farther down the road to see if that conclusion is still valid. These studies found that populations grew more significantly in communities not serviced by the system, employment opportunities also increased in communities not serviced by BART however, executive, professional and technical jobs increased significantly along BART routes over a 20 year period. They also found that downtown San Francisco experienced the most benefit from the system, while other communities did not see much impact on their demographics or built environment. This article is incredibly useful because it provides a perspective of the impacts of a system more than 20 years after the completion of construction. It is a perspective that will be useful when examining the possible impacts of a new transit system in York Region because the settings are somewhat comparable as suburban locations with low density and high reliability on vehicle travel. },
